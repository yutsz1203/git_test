"This course introduces basic concepts and principles in the field of sociology, helping students to make sense of their social life. Ideas such as social norms, social roles, social interactions, social institutions and social processes will be examined. This course also gives a brief introduction to major classical and contemporary sociological theories which explain how individuals and society are related to each other, especially how personal experiences are rooted in a particular social setting. Through these discussions, students should be able to think more critically towards a wide range of social issues and taken for granted social practices."
"Designed for major students new to sociology, this course serves as an extended introduction to sociology’s distinctive approach to the study of social life. It also aims at setting the foundation for the development of a variety of skills required for the study of discipline. It is also part of the Sociology Department’s academic mentorship programme that helps students better adjust to studying sociology, for example to learn to write better academic essay, and plan for themselves in their undergraduate years."
"(UGEC1823 is double-coded with SOCI1102.) This course explores into the significance of sociological perspectives in understanding modern society. Attention will be given to the application of sociological concepts in the observation and analysis of social phenomena in modern society. The course is designed particularly to develop intellectual skills, as part of a student's general education, for a better understanding of the nature of modern society."
"From the “borrowed time and borrowed place”, Hong Kong has evolved into a global city with its own identity. Since the 1950s, the city experienced an economic miracle, withstood numerous financial crises, and is in the process of economic restructuring. Politically, it has turned from “the last Colony” of Great Britain into a Special Administrative Region of the PRC. Culturally, the flourishing Canto pop-culture coincides with the emergence of a local identity. Using a sociological perspective, this course critically reflects on the impact of these profound changes on the construction of the so-called ‘Hong Kong identity’. Who is a HongKongese? This seemingly simple question underlies critical issues and boundaries about nationality, ethnicity, language, culture, class, and citizenship. The construction of a Hong Kong identity necessitates the drawing of boundaries that include and exclude, defines who is entitled to resources and power and who is not, and projects differential expectations of rights and responsibilities on insiders and outsiders. The question thus has profound impacts on how resources and power are distributed in society, and affects the life chances of individuals, families and society.(Advisory: Not for Sociology Majors.)"
"This is a course on some essential dimensions of modern life including love, sex, work, public life, illness and death. To marry or not to marry? To die sooner or later? These are real choices for some people but irrelevant questions for many. Do we have freedom to lead a life of our own or has society already chosen the path of life for each of us? These are issues either taken for granted or deliberately avoided in our everyday life. In this course, sociological theories will be introduced to analyse how social institutions in the modern world have affected the meaning and pattern of life. Students are encouraged to have a reflective mind so as to contemplate what life style, or at least what attitude, we can choose regarding these dimensions of life."
"This course is an introduction to the fundamental principles and procedures of empirical research in sociology. Students will be presented with the theoretical and practical challenges involved in problem formulation, research design, data collection, and data analysis. We will examine some of the major types of both qualitative and quantitative social research methods (e.g., survey research, qualitative interviews, and ethnography) and the sampling, measurement and analysis issues involved with their use. We will also explore the ethical issues about conducting research in contemporary times. Students will be asked to conduct and report a basic research project involving either a quantitative or qualitative method."
This course introduces the basic principles of statistical reasoning and its applications in social research. The objectives are to understand the basic assumptions of statistical methods and to interpret statistical findings in social surveys and experiments. Emphasis will be given to those descriptive and inferential methods that are frequently used for analyzing causal relationships among social variables and for testing social theories and hypotheses. The course will train students in analyzing social life and its changes.
"This course examines the origin, the transformation, and the characteristics of major Chinese thought in the past two millennia, so as to understand the sources of the values that guide the behaviour of Chinese people. The thought under examination include Confucianism, Legalism, Daoism, Moism, Liberalism, as well as different versions of Socialism. Methodologically speaking, this course will look at the structural forces that produce social thought and vice versa, rather than undue attention to particular times and events in history."
"The course examines the social and cultural dynamics of Japanese society. Emphasis will be given to the sociological implications of Japanese social organization and national identity especially as productions of a historical relationship with China and the West. Topics include: class and stratification, economic organization and work culture, marriage and the family, sex and gender, popular culture and everyday life, and the ideological system."
"The objective of this course is to review and reflect on the efforts made by sociologists to understand the development of the Hong Kong society over the past half century. What is so special about Hong Kong? Why did it fascinate sociologists for so long in the post-war era? What had been the questions that caught their imagination? Has Hong Kong been falling out of the radar of sociologists? What do sociologists know about Hong Kong, and what more have to be done?"
"(UGEC2883 is double-coded with SOCI2106.)  Focusing on economic reforms, students will be taught the impetus of the institutional changes in China and how they affect the cultural, socioeconomic and organizational lives of Chinese people. Key social science concepts and theories like institution, ideology, socialism, marketization, social control, civil society, industrialization, urbanization, stratification, family, socialization, and specialized terms in China studies like guanxi (關係), danwei (單位), hukou (戶口), harmonious society, China dream, floating population, rural-urban divide, one/two child(ren) policy, will be introduced and discussed from an integrated perspective. After taking this course, students should be able to grasp the transformation and development in key areas of China, including economic reform, political system and change, rural and urban development, social inequality, family and marriage, cultural and ideological issues, as well as other institutional developments."
"(UGEC2983 is double-coded with SOCI2116.)  Students enrolled in this cross-disciplinary course will address three basic questions: “why do people become criminals”, “who makes criminal law”, and “how is criminal law enforced”. Specifically, this course will include topics such as the social causes of criminal behaviour, the role of criminal law in social control, and the operation of the criminal justice system (their internal interaction and external interaction with other social organizations). Comparative and local empirical research will also be drawn to explore the crime problems and the development of criminal law and the criminal justice system in USA, PRC, Taiwan and Hong Kong. In addition, to strengthen the students’ understandings on the current criminal justice system, students will be given one field opportunity to directly experience police departments, courts or prisons in Hong Kong."
Both the objective conditions and the subjective definitions of social problems will be analysed in the context of social and economic development of society. The first emphasis of this course will be placed upon the application of basic sociological perspectives to the understanding of social issues and problems in Hong Kong and other societies. The second will examine the impact of sociological research of social problems on the formulation and improvement of social policy in response. The last emphasis will explore how sociological study of social problems are relevant to achieving UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
"Sociology has always had an intimate relationship with cities. Urbanization — the increase of the share of the population living in cities — was one of the developments that early sociologists sought to study and explain. Since then, the global urban population has only continued to increase. Today, over half of humanity lives in cities and towns. Understanding urban society is no less essential than it was in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Urban sociology has many sides, but in this course students will learn about four main topics: 1) the distinctive social character of the “urban experience,” 2) the economic role of cities within society, 3) the dynamics of investment in urban land and the construction of the “built environment” in cities, and 4) major social problems facing urban areas today including poverty, affordability, safety, and the effects of climate change. Through all of these topics, the readings and lectures will focus on international examples and trends, while the assignments will require students to reflect on their own experience of city life and to undertake hands-on observation and analysis of Hong Kong."
"(UGEC2963 is double-coded with SOCI2216.)  China’s opening to the world has led to not only massive social and economic transformations, but also the emergence of social problems. This course explores some of these social problems, especially since the economic reform after 1978. The nature of these social problems and their possible causes will be critically examined, in the context of modernization, with the help of related concepts and theories in sociology. By the end of the course, students are expected to have a basic understanding of the major social problems in contemporary China and their implications for social and economic developments of China in the future."
"This course discusses the major theoretical debates in sociology of marriage and family. Particularly, it looks at family structure and processes from various theoretical perspectives. Topics include major family transitions in adult life, such as love, mate selection, cohabitation, marriage, parenthood, divorce and remarriage. Special attention will be given to diversity of family forms, changing sex-role norms, class and childrearing practices, power and division of family labour, linkages between the family and the work systems. Whenever possible, family issues will be discussed and illustrated with examples in Chinese society."
"This course explores some of the major issues concerning the role of the youth and the problems confronting them in modern society. The nature of the conventional wisdom of the “youth problem” is critically examined, with the help of concepts and theories in sociology and related fields. By the end of the course, students are expected to gain more understanding of the nature of the phenomenon of problematization of youth, and to look beyond common sense or public perception on current social issues related to the youth in modern society. More importantly, youth problems can jeopardize the sustainable development of youth. A broader and deeper understanding of various facets of problematization can inform how youth should be empowered to attain sustainable development in modern society."
"The purpose of this course is to familiarize students with: (1) the nature, significance, issues and concepts of complex organizations in modern societies; (2) the approaches to, or the schools of thought on, organizational analysis; and (3) the structure and behaviour of complex organizations."
"This course discusses principles of allocation and reallocation of valuable social resources among different sectors of the population. Topics include fundamental concepts of social stratification, historical development of social inequality, classical and contemporary theories of class, social mobility, contradiction between equality and equity, implications of labour market segmentation and globalization on social equality."
"This course examines the foundations of sociological theory as laid out by the classic writers at the end of the nineteenth century. The main focus will be on the work of the three great founding theorists of sociology: Karl Marx, Max Weber, and Emile Durkheim.The focus of this course will be a close examination of original texts and the ideas expressed in them (rather than their application to contemporary issues). The aim is for student to appreciate the complexity, possibly even inconsistency, of these writers, something that gets lost in textbook representation of Marx, Weber, and Durkheim."
"Social networks affect many aspects of our lives, and their effect persists over the life course. The science of social networks focuses on measuring, modeling, and understanding the different ways that people are connected to one another. In this course, we will use a broad toolkit of theories and methods drawn from the social, natural, and mathematical sciences to learn what a social network is, to understand how to work with social network data, and to illustrate some of the ways that social networks can be useful in theory and in practice. This course is designed to provide students with the opportunity to (i) master the major concepts within the field of social networks, with a particular attention to social capital theory; (ii) critically examine the causes and consequences of social networks across a variety of behavioral contexts and academic domains; and (iii) achieve minimum competency in social network analysis."
"This course introduces students to the nature and social correlates of deviance and crime from the sociological approach. Methodological problems in the measurement of criminality and their implications for various theories of crime will be examined. Lastly, issues in formal and informal control and prevention of crime will be discussed."
"As an academic specialty, economic sociology faces a problem. Isn’t the social science that studies the economy just … economics? The economic sociologist must contend, in response to such a doubt, that there are some distinctive insights that result from a sociological perspective on the economy. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to some of these insights. The first half of the course lays out the general perspectives that have been developed by economic sociologists, and the second half covers some of the specific topics of research that have been major focuses for economic sociology. In all, students will leave this course with an appreciation of the lenses through which sociologists view the economy as well as a deeper knowledge of important contemporary economic institutions and trends."
"This course takes up gender as the primary object of study and category of analysis. It aims to: 1) understand the conceptualization of sex and gender by various scholars and the implications of their theorization; 2) understand the process of becoming a woman/ man via the social construction of masculinity, femininity, sexuality and the body;3) understand the implications of being a woman/man on our lived experience, and the mechanisms that reproduce and maintain the observed gaps between the two sexes in daily lives or various institutions, e.g. family, education, and labour markets etc."
"The course introduces students to social psychology, a field that bridges the disciplines of sociology and psychology. With a sociological emphasis, the course focuses on the link and interrelationship between individual level and group level phenomena. It examines three main areas: (1) a person’s inner attributes, motives, and feelings, and how these are influenced by group and social forces; (2) interactions and interpersonal relationships among individuals; (3) group dynamics and social structures as emergent phenomena from individual and interpersonal processes."
"Most every sociology course on a specific domain of social life includes a discussion of the major theories proposed by sociologists in that specialty. This course is different. Here, students will learn not about theories of some specific sociological specialty, but instead contemporary sociological theories — period, full stop. What is offered by this course is an introduction to perspectives on society that link together the different facets of social life. These perspectives claim that the same insights can illuminate not just, say, education but also work and the family. They represent lens that can be used to view and understand these various social spheres, or they identify common trends that affect them. Students will gain from this course a deeper understanding of the most general questions asked by sociologists today, and which link together the more narrowly focused view of each individual study or subfield.We strongly encourage students to take SOCI3003 before taking this course."
"This course investigates the relationships between society, culture and political system with emphasis on the social base of democracy. Topology of regimes, philosophical and institutional meanings of democracy, transition from totalitarianism or authoritarianism to democracy, the complex relationships between democracy and civil society, civic culture, economic development and other social factors will be discussed."
"This course is designed to enhance the writing skills of sociology students so that they are more competent in meeting the writing needs of their discipline, especially in preparing adequate research-related papers such as proposals and reports. Students will learn such essential skills as writing effective sentences and coherent paragraphs, summarizing, paraphrasing, acknowledging sources and listing references, and understanding and describing data. They will study actual research papers to see how each main section is prepared in a proper academic style, and will practise writing paragraphs that represent the various sections of a research report.Advisory: For Sociology Majors only. Students are required to take a written test before admission to this course."
"This course introduces students to the understanding of the motion picture industry in sociological perspectives. It will focus on the key theoretical approaches from sociology to the study of the media and culture, and show how they can be applied to empirical research on the film industry. It will draw on both academic research and a range of multimedia resources and illustrative materials, including media texts and video, to explore the changing role and constitution of the motion picture industry in contemporary societies."
"This course investigates social demographic phenomena in both structural and dynamic aspects. Causes and consequences of demographic trends at local, national and global levels will be examined. Subjects like population theories; determinants of population dynamics such as fertility, mortality and migration; and the integration of social and demographic theories will also be discussed."
"The focus of this course is on hands-on data analysis and the practical application of basic statistical methods to real-world social problems. Topics include causality, measurement, probability and statistical theory, regression models, analyses of network, textual, and spatial data. Particular attention will be paid to learning and implementing the R statistical program. Having taken Social Statistics (SOCI 2004 or equivalent elsewhere) and prior computing experience might be helpful but not required."
"In media coverage and many popular discussions on the topic, China features prominently as the “driver” of globalization or as the “workshop of the world”. Yet these simple observations leave much un-said. What is exactly meant by “globalization”? What is China’s experience of globalization? What are the political, cultural, and economic implications of living in an increasingly globalized world? Is China’s experience in this regard unique or similar to those of other countries? These are among the questions we will set out to explore in this course."
"This course aims to provide students with a foundation in the fundamental principles and procedures of empirical research in sociology. It will introduce various major types of qualitative research methods. Students will learn about various strategies for collecting (e.g. in-depth interview/focus group discussion, participant observation/ethnography, visual methods) and analyzing qualitative data (e.g. analyses of narrative, conversation and discourse, as well as grounded theory), They will also familiarize themselves with the ethical issues about conducting research in contemporary times."
"This course critically explores how sexual desires, behaviors, and identities interact with larger cultural, social, economic and political forces. Throughout the course, it discusses how sexualities are bound up with struggles over citizenship, rights, entitlement and inequalities. As a whole, the course aims to open up space to debate how we may learn to live with ‘differences’ in an increasingly diverse world."
"This course introduces the sociology of policing to students who wish to advance their understanding of the enforcement of law in a society. With a comparative perspective, the course examines institutions of police with regard to their role, function, organizational structures and culture in the contemporary world. Starting with a historical review of colonial policing in Hong Kong, the course unfolds gradually to reveal common policing issues and proceeds to assess the impact of transnational events like cross-border crime and global protest on local policing. Case studies of police practices in both local and global contexts are critically evaluated to identify the social forces that shape the respective social control process."
"This course explores social phenomena that are so familiar they can escape our notice. Yet, they are highly organized and massively important to our lives. We will introduce the methodology of video analysis in sociology as a way to investigate social interaction in everyday life. Video analysis has been used to study a large variety of activities, for example, how people greet each other, how families eat together, how people taste cheese before buying, how skateboarders take turns in pool skate sessions, how people pass through doors, how tourists use Google maps to navigate through a city, and so on. The course is hands-on. You will be taught how to make your own video-recordings, as well as how to transcribe and analyse your data. There will be frequent in-class activities and discussions, so you are expected to be prepared and ready to contribute. Through your engagement in the course, you will gain an appreciation of the importance of real-time, observable behaviours for the accomplishment and maintenance of social interaction. You will also develop your powers of observation, attention to detail, and analytical skills."
"Any consideration of global citizenship is incomplete without an examination of migration as part and parcel of the contemporary world. This course provides an introductory understanding of migration. To understand the operation of migration, we first discuss the general theories of immigrant adaptation. The theoretical framework for understanding migration ranges from the classic Chicago School to the recent institutional approach to migration. We then explore how the adaptation and survival strategies taken by immigrants. Policies governing migration and their impact on global citizenship are also discussed."
"Health is a fundamental aspect of human existence and medicine is arguably the crown jewel of modern science. We all want good health, effective treatments of illness and affordable health care. Yet present-day health care is the flashpoint of many controversies: about the conflicts between patients and doctors; about the safety of medical treatments and reliability of medical knowledge; about inequality in health and longevity; and about the ever-increasing health care spending. This course dissects these issues from a sociological perspective. We ask questions such as: What counts as illness? How do people understand illness? How does illness affect people’s life? Who gets ill and why? What is the role of medical technology in fostering health? Why do doctors and patients have trouble communicating? How should health care systems be organized?"
"Changes in technology—specifically the transition from the analogue age to the digital age—request a new visit to longstanding sociological questions and a comprehensive approach to the epistemic, methodological and normative issues of computational social science as an emerging interdisciplinary field. This course introduces digital forms of research that advances theories of human behaviour by applying computational techniques to large-scale data from social media, dynamic networks, real-time digitised and administrative records, and social simulations. This course also applies sociological perspectives and concepts to understand new social problems that we face in the age of big data and new media."
"This course is designed to help students acquire fundamental knowledge and skills to examine and analyze the various environmental challenges in contemporary societies from a sociological perspective. Recognizing that environmental problems are often intricately connected with the conditions of societies that they are situated in, we will explore the processes underlying social and environmental changes as well as the consequences that those processes may entail at national, regional, and global levels. Substantive topics to be covered include limits of growth and development, sustainable production and consumption, climate change and global governance, and environmental movement. The course also aims to promote an awareness and understanding of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) framework put forward by the United Nations in 2015 so as to facilitate a broader discussion and reflection on how individuals and societies can work together and find solutions to those environmental challenges."
"In the past decades, the world witnessed a sea change in the influence that scientific knowledge has in shaping the course of our economy and culture. From the development of iPhone to the Covid-19 vaccine, ours is a society organized around and even controlled by expert knowledge systems. Meanwhile, science itself also underwent increasingly fiercer attack by outsiders, a typical example being the disagreement on whether the climate change is real. Sociology of scientific knowledge offers us a set of tools to understanding and analyzing these heatedly debated big questions in society today. By critically analyzing science, scientists, and the system of knowledge production that they created and maintained, this course surveys major topics and recent developments in the social studies of science. The arrangement of these topics follows a micro-to-macro sequence: First, the course discusses personal level STEM experiences, such as STEM educational pipeline and STEM job market; then, the course discusses institutional and disciplinary level analysis of how science works and how innovations come about; lastly, the course moves on to society, national, and international level of the impact of science, using examples from the platform economy, the international politics and the global pandemic. By the end of the course, students will develop basic knowledge towards the Technology Facilitation Mechanism for supporting the Sustainable Development Goals, through critically examining the multistakeholder collaboration between scientific community, nation states and other stakeholders in the STI policy cycle."
"(UGEC3893 is double-coded with SOCI3241.) This course introduces undergraduate students to the knowledge world of global and transnational sociology, and the sociology of law, globalization and global governance, in which it will offer a guided entry into the complex ideas and writings of the sociological, political and legal scholars. The concepts they developed to analyze law, society and global governance are fundamental to address global and international concerns, including ESG (environmental, social & governance) investment, SDG (sustainable development goals), global climate change (Paris Agreement), global health (WHO), international economic, trade and monetary institutions (e.g., World Bank, WTO, IMF), global gender, children, labor and human rights systems (UNICEF, ILO, OHCHR), international law (ICJ) and international peace and security (UN Security Council). Upon completing this course, student will have critical understanding of the process in which UN intergovernmental bodies, states and non-governmental stakeholders coordinate at the inter-organizational and inter-institutional levels to implement the UN 2030 Agenda, and respond to the challenges within."
"To Sutherland and Cressey, criminology is the body of knowledge regarding crime as social phenomena, which encompasses the process of making laws, breaking laws, and reacting to the breaking of laws. With a comparative perspective, this course focuses on how governments and law enforcement agencies in different societies intervene in the breaking of laws in a globalized world. The course begins by introducing various concepts of social control from a sociological standpoint. In addition to a review of the relevant criminological theories and empirical research findings, the course assesses the major impact of globalization on public security and explores the proliferation of transnational criminal activities in the process. Finally, the course will examine how social control agencies react and seek to address these problems in local and global context."
"This course is a nontechnical introduction to the intellectual and methodological developments that undergird the exciting new era of social research using randomized experimental and quasi-experimental designs. Through in-depth case studies of exemplary empirical studies based on randomized experimental/quasi-experimental designs, the course will demonstrate how basic research could help understand human attitudes/perceptions/behaviors and provide evidence-based guidance for policymaking.This course is intended for students in their third or fourth year of college. The course coverage will be helpful to students who intend to pursue more advanced academic training, government sector jobs that place a premium on program evaluation and quantitative literacy, or service industry jobs that have witnessed a surging demand for big data applications. A one-term course on basic statistics is essential for understanding the technical but elementary terms used in this course. Still, math and statistical skills are not required to excel in this course.Specifically, the course is designed to achieve three learning objectives:1. To master the generalized experimental methodology by studying the core principles of experimental designs and some exemplary social science experimental studies. 2. To ask real-world questions that can be answered with randomized experiments (of various forms) to understand human perceptions/behaviors, induce behavioral changes, and inform evidence-based policymaking.3. To gain intuitive understanding of the counterfactual paradigm for causal thinking (i.e., using quasi-experimental designs) when truly randomized experiments are infeasible.Evaluation of learning progress and performance will closely align with the course objectives. The course assessments would emphasize the conceptual and empirical understandings of experimental designs and their real-world applications through a group project presentation and a short research proposal written by individuals. The primary language of instruction, teaching materials, and students’ written submissions will be in English."

"The course focuses on the practical procedures of conducting sample surveys and analysis of complex survey data in social science research. The primary objective of the course is for students to understand modern techniques for design-based analysis of complex sample survey data. The course will first examine key steps in conducting survey research, from formation of research problem and hypothesis, sampling methods, questionnaire construction, types of data collection, handling of nonresponse and missing data, to data management, statistical analysis and inference, and interpretation of results. A secondary objective of the course is to introduce ‘unconventional’ data types in social science research, such as texts, social media and web data, and research strategies for analysis and visualization. The course emphasizes hands-on experiences with statistical software in data processing and analysis."
"Service-learning is a form of experiential learning in that students engage in cycle of service, knowledge application and reflection. This course provides Sociology students with an array of opportunities to engage in an immersive community service-learning experience. Working with community partners under the guidance of course instructor as well as mentors (in-service Sociology alumni teachers or community workers), students will complete specific projects and volunteer activities catered for specific learning needs of a student group in real-life setting, like teaching/tutoring/sharing knowledge, or designing a series of lessons particular topic on particular topic or problem the selected student group encountered. Using the sociological imagination, students will identify the problem/ topic, gather information, design teaching/ learning objectives and outcomes, adopt appropriate delivering strategies, implement the plan with collaboration with their fellows and community partners. Upon completion of the practicum, students will put their sociological knowledge into dialogue with the experiential input from the service-learning setting, activities, and community partners through structured in-class discussions."
"This course introduces to students the key theories, approaches, and ideas in the field of sociology of education. We will explore influential studies in sociology of education, and link them to educational challenges and problems in the real world. Education-related topics covered in this course will include stratification and inequality, school, family, peers, community, rural-urban divide, migration, gender, technology, mental health, mass education, and elite formation, among others. Through studying these topics, we will also discuss how education is connected to individual, community, and national development, such as whether education reduces poverty and promotes social mobility. Readings will not be region-specific but topic-based, covering empirical evidence across the world and representing the typical research questions on a particular topic. By reading and discussing empirical studies throughout the course, students will learn how to discover and analyze the key sociological and practical issues of education both locally and internationally."
"This course is designed as a survey of the major sociological theories of social movements. These theories will be further elucidated by discussing different types of social movements such as labour movement, the women’s movement, gay right movement, environmental movement, pro-democracy movements and the U.S. civil rights movement."
"The first part of this course introduces students to the diverse perspectives of cultural sociology. Both classical and contemporary approaches will be covered, from Karl Marx and Max Weber to the critical theorists and the postmodernists. The second part of the course centres upon the empirical facets of culture, tackling such cultural issues and phenomena as subculture, high culture, popular culture, material culture, culture and the media, culture and power, as well as culture and ideology."
"Many sociologists predicted that religion would gradually fade away in modern society and ‘modernity’ would eventually triumph over the ‘enchanted world’. On the contrary, the revival of traditional religions, blooming of new religious cults/sects, wide spread charismatic movement and fundamentalist movement of various sorts are taking place. Some contemporary sociologists therefore argued that we are in an age of ‘re-enchantment’ instead of ‘disenchanted’ modern society.The course will be divided in two parts. In the first part, we will start from Max Weber’s theory to see how sociologists conceived the relation between religion and modernity as well as their conflicts. In the second part, we will go through contemporary issues concerning religious fundamentalism, religion and society in East Asia, China and Hong Kong."
"What is science? What, if anything, is special about the way that scientists generate knowledge? And is scientific knowledge free of social influences? The first part of this course reviews how skeptical arguments from the philosophy of science (e.g., Popper and Kuhn) paved the way for the argument that scientific knowledge may be ‘socially constructed’. The second part provides an introduction to theory and empirical research in the growing field of science and technology studies (STS), which emphasize the social, cultural and contingent nature of scientific development."
"Internship is a valuable educational experience that nurtures students’ competency for responding to challenges in the 21st Century. Integrating academic curriculum with supervised internship, this course provides students with the opportunity to make sense of real-life work experiences with the sociological imagination. Course seminars aim at two objectives: to advance students’ career preparedness with exposure to work, and to transform their sociological knowledge into sustainability skills that are essential for promoting organisational change for a sustainable future. Aside from gaining on-the-job skills, students will learn to apply sociological analysis to study their internship organisations in both private or public sectors. Utilizing critical thinking – a core feature of sociological training, students will identify and reflect on specific values, goals, workflow and structure, and social and environmental impacts of an organisation through their first-hand experiences in various professions. To successfully enrol this course, students must secure their local internship arrangement through obtaining approval from the field supervisor and the course instructor. Students must complete a minimum of 100 hours of supervised internship work aside from the regular course assignments and attending course seminars."

It reviews the basic principles, procedures, objectives, and ethics of conducting social search. It introduces the common data collection and analysis methods, including survey, experiment, interview, observation, ethnography, big data, statistical analysis, causal inference, case study, content analysis, and process tracing. These methods will also be applied in group research projects. By taking this course, students will:• understand what social research is and know the ethics of social research;• be familiar with the common social research methods;• know how to appreciate and evaluate existing social research; and • practice social research and learn to present and write research findings."
This course discusses the basic principles of statistical reasoning and their applications in social research. Basic techniques for descriptive and inferential analysis will be discussed to enhance students’ ability in analysing associations between social variables in the context of theory and hypothesis testing. Students will be given opportunities to use statistical software for analysing survey data. No prior computing experience is required.
The aim of this course is to familiarize the students with the theoretical traditions and development of the field of Sociology. Three focal areas will be covered to obtain a condensed overview of the major theoretical perspectives involved: 1) the contemporary relevance and revisions of the core Sociological traditions; 2) significant theoretical controversies and issues; 3) current attempts towards frameworks of theoretical integration.
"The course will discuss the impetus of institutional change in contemporary China (1949 -) and its impacts on social and political lives of Chinese people. Key social science concepts such asideology, socialism, marketization, patron-clientelism, social control, civil society, industrialization, urbanization, class formation, social inequality, gender, family and special terms such as guanxi,danwei, hukou, floating population, three-represents, harmonious society, China's dream. etc. will be introduced."
"Globalization has emerged as one of the most talked about concepts in the contemporary world. This course takes globalization as the master trend leading to profound changes in social life everywhere and will examine its multi-faceted manifestations in economic, political and cultural dimensions. Guided by the sociology of development, this course will seek to develop a broad interdisciplinary approach to the academic debates over globalization. Particular attention will also be paid to the challenges that globalization poses on human development and the responses that the global community has fashioned to tackle these challenges."
"Seemingly citizens of the modern society live with increasing affluence and liberty. Yet lurking behind prosperity and development is the widening of regional and social inequalities, the persistence of social exclusion and discrimination, the emergence of new forms of crime and deviance, and the escalation of violence intertwined with advanced technology and fundamentalism. Using insights froma variety of sociological theories, including the Foucaultian, Marxist, Feminist, and Postmodern perspectives, this course engages students to the sociological debates about the meanings, patterns, causes, and consequences of these issues, and their impact on the sense of being and identity."
"This course examines the relationship between education institution and the society. It offers a sociological perspective on social processes and outcomes of schooling. Topics such as major sociological theories on education, their application in analyzing the structure and processes of schooling as an organization and an institution, effects of education on societal level (the function of allocation and selection of education, credential system etc.) as well as the individual level (such as socialization and social stratification) are covered in the course. Empirical studies in Hong Kong, China as well as other societies will be adopted as illustration of theoretical analysis and application. Upon the completion of the course, students are expected to have basic understanding of sociology of education, and the capability to reflect on the meaning and significance of schools and schooling experiences in a sociological way."
"Contents and requirements of this course depend on expertise of the instructor. The objective is to strengthen students' knowledge in a sub-field of sociology. Discussion will focus on current theoretical debates, research issues, and methodological approaches.Topic: Please refer to the Department for details."

"Health is a fundamental aspect of human existence and medicine is arguably the crown jewel of modern science. We all want good health, effective treatments of illness and affordable health care. Yet present-day health care is the flashpoint of many controversies: about the reliability of medical knowledge; and about inequalities in health and longevity. This course dissects these issues from a sociological perspective. We ask questions such as: What counts as illness? How do people understand illness? How does illness affect people’s life? Who gets ill and why? What is the role of medical technology in fostering health? Why do doctors and patients have trouble communicating?This course surveys major approaches and areas in the sociological study of health, illness and medicine. The central idea is that we cannot understand the topics of health, illness and medicine simply by looking at the biological phenomena and medical knowledge, but instead, we must also consider a variety of social, political, economic, and cultural forces."
"This course analyzes and delineates the sociohistroical invention and construction of seemingly distinctive ""Japanese"" institutions and cultural values shaped by various global forces in the historical process. Specifically, it attempts to depict a dynamic picture of how modern and contemporary Japan from the Meiji to the Heisei (1868-2018) period tried to respond to the idea of ""modernity"" and the ""Western."" Through a guided tour of Japan's experiences of the modern, the course shows both the enlightenment and despair brought by a series of political, social and cultural struggles for one to assert itself as a legitimate nation-state as seen from the eyes of others."
"Although some theorists claim that ‘class is dead’ and thus fails to explain contemporary society, our daily life is still influenced by class factors, not only in terms of resource allocation but also in the ways we conduct our social life. In this course, we will explore how class shapes our lifestyles, housing, association patterns, life chances, education strategies, parent-child interaction, subjective identification and even political orientation. We do not simply take class as objective structural positions; we also perceive class as crucial social boundaries and distinctions that have to be practiced, performed and reproduced in various social fields. Such a perspective will help us to discover and reflect how our social life is ‘classed’."
"This thesis project course provides students a hands-on opportunity to complete an individual research on a topic of interest under the instructor’s supervision. Students will be able to gain the firsthand experience in developing a research project and to consolidate their knowledge and skills in research methods. Through classroom trainings and individual consultations, the instructor will provide appropriate guidance to students during each stage of the research process and thesis writing."
"The course explores relevant issues in the current conflicting society, particularly in the case of Hong Kong. Using relevant sociological theories and perspectives, students will be engaged in studying prevalent forms of criminal behavior and associated social issues, which have been brought about by rapid social changes.Topics under discussion include the relationship between social development, social forces and crime, ranging from the traditional crime, such as drug abuse, to sophisticated commercial crime and internet crime, such as ‘distributed denial of service attack’, and transnational crime such as money laundering.Social perception, responses and different approaches in the preventive strategies will also be reviewed."
"This course introduces the concepts and theories for understanding the fundamental aspects of organizational design and behavior. A number of issues at the macro level, including organizational structure, external environment, corporate culture, organizational effectiveness will be considered. Major organizational processes, such as power and control, conflict, decision-making, innovation and change will be discussed. At the individual and group level, important topics like job attitudes, motivation, performance, and teamwork will also be covered."
"This course is primarily intended to give graduate students a detailed introduction to some foundational theoretical questions and positions in sociology. It is centered on the writings of Max Weber, Emile Durkheim, and Karl Marx, supplemented by other (and more recent) theoretical work. The readings and seminar discussions will cover three mains sets of issues: 1) the relationship between the individual and society; 2) the special challenges and problems confronting a science of society; and 3) theoretical accounts of key modern social structures. Secondarily, students will through a series of exercises leading up to a final paper gain practice in the essential skill of “reading and writing with theories.”The course grade will be based on a term paper, which will be assigned a letter grade according to following rubric:The “significant progress” mentioned in the rubric will be judged in reference to the writing exercises completed during the second half of the course but which will not be graded separately."
"This is an intensive training course on the logic of theory construction and the logic of evidence building in empirical sociology. The theoretical and evidential logics provide the foundation for the effective use of qualitative and quantitative data analysis alike. The course will provide the tools for clarifying the theoretical and evidential logics of an empirical study and introduce three families of explanatory mechanisms that are relevant to diverse subfields of sociology. Most importantly, the course will develop the competence of students in theory construction and evidence building through learning-by-doing. Much of the course will be devoted to a re-examination of many exemplary works in empirical sociology from each theoretical family. The course will not focus on any philosophical debate or technique of data analysis."
"This course focuses on the causal modelling on different types of data. A major part of the discussion will be given to OLS regression in order to illustrate the modelling techniques needed for causal analysis. With this foundation, the lecture will move on to discuss the more sophisticated methods that require a deeper understanding of the statistical literature. Discussion will emphasize both the statistical reasoning underlying these methods and their empirical applications. At the end of the course, students should have sufficient exposure to a wide range of analytical methods, helping them to appreciate the quantitative research literature and to conduct their own empirical analyses."
"This course examines qualitative methods used in social science research. Since qualitative research is both an ‘analytic mentality’ and a set of practical skills, the course will focus both discussions of key methodological and empirical readings as well as on practical skills, such as case and informant selection, field experiences, interview techniques, writing field notes, and analyzing and writing qualitative data. The course is in a seminar format. Lectures will be interwoven with discussions. Students are also required to conduct a small-scale pilot qualitative research project using the skills discussed in the seminar."
