"Students undertake a Selected Study Module (SSM), working on it throughout the academic year. The aim of SSM is to provide students with an opportunity to participate in a research project, critique scientific literature, conduct a topical analysis or systematic review, and acquire some of the skill sets needed for undertaking scientific research. Allowing free choice of project facilitates students to critically explore topics that they find interesting.Students who have successfully completed the Master of Science Programme in Research Medicine or GPS students who have successfully completed the interim report of the GPSU3100 GPS Project are exempted from the course."
