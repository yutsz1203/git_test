"“What distinguishes the successful entrepreneur and promoter from other people is precisely the fact that he does not let himself be guided by what was and is, but arranges his affairs on the ground of his opinion about the future. He sees the past and present as other people do; but he judges the future in a different way."" (Human Action, Ludwig von Mises, 1966)Entrepreneurial activities have become a potent source of economic power that generates enormous job opportunities and business innovation globally. This is particularly spectacular in the context of China where there are numerous cases of successful and failure cases of privately owned enterprises and collectively owned township and village enterprises growing from an embryonic stage into a larger firm. The course adopts a “life-cycle” approach and develops a set of accounting and managerial skills to analyze companies from the start-up stage to eventually cashing out."

"Independent study gives students added flexibility to design study programmes suited to a particular area of interest or to delve more deeply into a specific topic. Students need to find a faculty member willing to serve as the supervisor, and together, devise a format. There are a wide range of possibilities under independent study. The more common alternatives are: (a) Selection of a topic not normally covered in our curriculum in which the student has an interest. Normally the student would prepare a literature review on the selected topic. It would then be common for the student to perform some application or extension of this body of knowledge by extending or substantiating that knowledge by some data collection. (b) Preparation of a case and accompanying teacher’s note. The case must be based on real organizations and substantial data collection would be expected. The student would be expected to demonstrate application of theory in preparation of the teacher’s note."
