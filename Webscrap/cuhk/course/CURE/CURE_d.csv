How does our celebrity culture enrich Hong Kong and the world?Celebrity is a critical feature of (post)modern society, especially in our entertaining-oriented Hong Kong culture. Hong Kong had been influenced by foreign popular icons for many decades, but the affluent city also has its own culture of celebrity. From Elvis Presley and Beatles to Michael Jackson, Madonna and Lady Gaga; Bruce Lee (李小龍) to Jackie Chan (成龍) and Stephen Chow (周星馳); and even Princess Diana to Joshua Wong (黃之鋒), “well known people” of different areas, although not necessarily being stars of popular culture, have varied extent of social signification.

"(UGEC2243 is double-coded with CURE2018.)  Human have altered the environment in ways that have no precedence in human history. Ecological crisis, environmental degradation, and extreme weathers have become the watchwords of contemporary politics. The conventional boundaries between “nature” and “culture” are now being questioned. How do nature, culture and power intersect in our everyday life? How do we get to understand issues of sustainability and environmental crisis from a broad historical perspective and global activism angle? How are gender, class and race interact with technology, damaged environment, animal and plant species?

"This course is an introduction to the medical humanities, an interdisciplinary field of study that seeks to understand the social context of health and illness beyond the hospital, clinic, and laboratory. In particular, this course will emphasize the historical and cultural shaping of health disparities and examine how issues of power contribute to unequal patterns of risk and disease in our modern society. To do this, students will learn major theories and methods in the cultural study of health and medicine to understand how culture, power, and identity—including race, gender, capitalism, and colonialism— shapes the management of disease and individual illness experience in both Asian and global contexts. A critical concern in this course is how the organization of medical care confronts questions of social justice in medical treatment and public health in historical and contemporary contexts. Students will also grapple with the question of whether our institutions of medicine and public health function as a form of social control. By introducing students to the social components of health and illness, it aims to foster cross-disciplinary conversations across the faculties of arts, medicine, and other divisions at CUHK.Following the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal of Reducing Inequality (SDG #10), a central question in this course is how medical treatments, research, and public health confront, or fail to confront, issues of social justice in global contexts. Students will learn theoretical approaches to health and inequality to investigate how history, culture, and politics shape the illness experience of socially marginalized people. These theories will enable students to assess the strengths and limits of our current arrangements of medical care and approaches to global health. In addition, students will learn critical medical humanities methods, such as ethnography, and use these methods to propose solutions to our current shortcomings in health governance. This course will challenge students to imagine better alternatives to our unequal world and demonstrate why the study of culture matters in medicine, global health, and public policy."

We explore the importance of the factor of age in the study of popular culture, explaining why youths are vulnerable to the manipulation of popular culture, and why their lifestyles and values also dominate popular culture. We also examine how youth identity is constructed around the dynamics between mainstream identity and subcultural identity, and students are given the chance to analyse their own socio-cultural worlds in the various cultural environment, including home, school, concerts, shopping malls, youth magazines, and the cyber-space. This course provides students with an understanding of why youths, in particular, are prone to collective identity, and how they achieve their sense of self through fashion, music, sports, and entertainment."

The main question and thematic thread running through the course will be how the various traditions understand, express, and practice embodiment and transcendence. In other words, what are the constituents, changes, relationships, and possibilities for human beings and divinities with reference to the temporal world and transcendent reality? Where can we find significant ""family resemblances"" – without ignoring differences – among the diversities of persons and sub-traditions within those roughly designated Hindu, Jain, Buddhist, Muslim, Sikh, or Christian?"
"This course aims to give students an understanding of Islam as a religion along with an insight into the crucial issues facing Muslims throughout the world today.

The beliefs and practices of Muslims are explored through an indepth look at the five pillars of Islam. The variety of Islamic beliefs will be discussed in an investigation of Shi'i and Sufi traditions. The course concludes with contemporary issues of Islam in the world, interfaith connections, the place of women in Islam, and the presence of Muslims as political minorities in the West. In addition to this structure, local references to Islam in Hong Kong will be used to give an enhanced local perspective to these topics."

"The ""Arab World"" today refers to a large geographical area: from the Atlantic coast of North Africa in the West to the border of Iran in the East. Arabic is the principal spoken language of this region, which is also linked by shared cultural and religious traditions. The course presents a historical survey of the ""Arab World"" from pre-Islamic times to the modern era.

Two main themes referred to throughout the course will be the unity and diversity of the ""Arab World"" and how various Arab cultures and societies have interacted with other peoples in this region and beyond."
"(UGEC2500 is double-coded with CURE2375.) This course is a study of Chinese temples and festivals. Temples are cultural heritages which preserve as mute testimony to local history. Their structures and the use of ornaments also reflect traditional architectural characteristics. ""Jie dan"" (festivals), including birthdays of the gods and jiao rituals, are the ritual activities being held for prosperity in folk culture. The belief system, indigenous custom, human diasporas as well as community cohesiveness of the Chinese can be illustrated from both temples and festivals in China and Hong Kong."
"This course's objective is to acquaint students with the kindred relationships between film and literature as well as to help them develop a more critical awareness to appreciate these two media from a cultural studies perspective. It will cover the following topics: introduction to the art of film, the generic and mediumistic comparisons of film and literature: film and the novel or film and drama or the theatre, etc."
"(UGEC3481 is double-coded with CURE3003.) How do we understand and connect to animal kingdom?How do human-animal connections shape modern culture and society?How do cultural studies and humanities expand our scope on animal and nature?Culture is ordinary, in Raymond William’s saying, but the ordinariness is merely treated as a reflection of human everyday life. Although cultural studies has sustained concern on everyday life with mass production, consumerism, sexism, racism and postmodernism, the discipline always lags behind the concern of nature and animal species. As the issues of animal abuse, environmental protection, factory farming, animal protection policy and law-making, as well as media various portrayals being the hot topics of our (post)modern world, the study of animal with the perspective of cultural studies and other humanity disciplines can explore the possibilities of better human-animal relationship. This course is designed with an empathic concern of other-than-human animals. By exploring different issues of human and animals’ life, this course looks for a harmonious balance of nature and modern culture.This course focuses on three areas, through which we can explore the different aspects of animal and cultural studies. These areas are:A. Entering Jurassic Park – Remaking Animals in Leisure (Lecture A1-A4)B. Attacking Godzilla – Representing Animals in Media (Lecture B1-B4)C. Finding Nemo – Revitalizing Animals in the City  (Lecture C1-C4)Each area covers a set of animal issue discussion. Area A, apart from theorizing animal with cultural studies, tackles the basic animal issues: pet-nurturing, zoo-building, forest-sustaining and tourism. This is to provide a foundation for understanding animals with a critical reflection of everyday life. Area B, set with the concern of media, discusses issues of animal representation in cartoon, cinema, literature and journalism. This is to read how animals would be represented and how this affects human understanding and related policy-making. A screening will be run after Lecture Area B. This is to provide an alternative understanding of animal representation in popular media. Area C further deals with the matters of animal-city relationship in seeing how dogs and cats, cattle and swine, and fishes and dolphins are (mal)treated in the street, the farm and the sea respectively. This is to end the course with a leading thought of perfect balance of nature and modernity; and more queries of human-animal relationship will be raised for contemplation."
"The specific topics of this course vary from year to year. Generally, they can be genres, systems of representation, cultural forms, issues and/or theories related to the dynamic process of interactivity among cultures. Students are allowed to take this course not more than twice, and gain the units each time they pass the course."
"What is gender and why does it matter? What are the significances and limitations of gender as an analytic category? How are dominant understandings and practices of gender constructed and contested in different cultural forms and social contexts? This course is divided into three sections. The first section introduces the basic vocabulary of gender studies and how gender intersects with other forms of differences. The second section explores gender through various cultural products and media (e.g. literature, film, video games, theatre, social activism, etc.) The final section examines key debates in relation to gender in specific social contexts. Upon completion of this course, students would understand basic theoretical concepts for gender analysis and key debates on gender as well as gain the ability to think critically about gender."

The course will equip students with the basic knowledge and concepts in analysing the main issues and practices in cultural studies."
"This course investigates the multifaceted relationships between globalization and culture. Under the influence of globalization and increasing international trade, are we leading more diverse or homogenous lifestyles? Does globalization promote or hamper cultural changes? Why do the commercial world and cultural theorists read globalization so differently? In this course we will investigate how the developing global culture is influencing our daily lives from the perspectives of national and cultural identity, information society, consumerism, popular culture, etc. Emphasizing both theory and its application in analysing different kinds of texts (e.g., literature, films, maps, fashions, theme parks, shopping malls, etc.), we will discuss the changing meanings of citizenship, mobilization, technology, capital, space, and time under the influence of globalization."
"We are now experiencing fast developments in technoscience in the modern world. As everything turns electronic and hi-tech, e.g., email, ebanking, ecommerce, plus the newly developed sciences such as cloning, biogenetic engineering, etc., it is important to introduce to students the ways technosciences and mass media bear on our sense of identity and subjectivity. The aim of this course is to help students make sense of different ramifications of contemporary technosciences which have unprecedentedly transformed their everyday life experiences, in other words, to introduce them to the study of technoscience culture. Through a body of fiction, films, T.V. shows, computer mediated communication devices, cybercultural forms (VR and AI), etc., which deal directly with new communication technologies, this class will highlight the radical effects on the centrality of visual culture in the modern world, on the post-modernist self and on virtuality of all kinds."
"The emerging culture is taking place in the virtual world. New technological inventions often challenge existing social structures by introducing new rules for social relationship, ethical, educational, cultural and political infrustructures of a society. This course will explore popular topics in new media with emphasis on the internet, social media, digital media and other forms of mass media which developed from the 1990s. “The world is getting flat”, from mainstream to personal media, dialtone to iphone, resume to linkedIn, photo album to facebook, the focus of discussion is on the evolution, impact and new development of new media in cultural, communicational, aesthetical, entertainmental and economical aspects and life styles. That includes understanding of cultural interfaces on websites, computer mediated communication and literacy, cyber psychology, new media arts and creativity, digital marketing, web 2.0 and social media, the study of various social phenomena associated with the cyberspace and other new forms of network communication which has a strong impact in our current life."

Students will be required to attend guest lectures, field visits as well as other exhibitions or events related to the cultural and creative industries as prescribed by the course tutor."
"Introduce students to various disciplines of cultural criticism, from literature, film, urban cultures, art performances and policies, etc. and a blend of all these. Different approaches of cultural criticism will be practised, from textual, formalistic to ideological ones, realizing each power and limitation. Writing styles (e.g. interpretive, provocative, deconstructive, prescriptive) and the related critics' roles will be examined too. Students will be encouraged to put their understanding of cultural theory in general to current cultural issues happening in the society at large. Both reading and writing will be stressed, with the aim of enlarging their reading scope (e.g. from local to China Mainland to foreign media) and enriching their hands-on writing experience."
"Nationalism is a major world-wide response to the increasingly globalized world, which witnesses an exponential increase in the movement of capital, labor, commodities, cultures and ideas, yet has threatened established ways of life and rendered states and peoples vulnerable to economic pressures. This course provides a broad overview of the theories of and approaches to the study of nationalist thoughts and practices. It understands nationalism's emergence and its endurance as a major cultural politics in a globalized world. It explores nationalism as it is linked to various modern socio-political and cultural effects: national consciousness, ethnic and identity conflicts, state building, nationalist ideologies and nationalist movements. It examines the politics of nationalism and ethnicity with reference to experiences in developing societies in Asia in the course of colonial encounters and in post-colonial contexts. It examines the various ways in which politics of nationalism has influenced economic modernization, globalization, gender relations, social conflicts, cultural citizenship debates and post-colonial struggles."
"(UGEC3482 is double-coded with CURE3033.) This course is a survey of Southeast Asian cinema read against the backdrop of its distinct historical, political, ecological, and cultural conditions. Initially a Cold War construct comprising Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Cambodia, Brunei, Laos, and Timor-Leste, the term ‘Southeast Asia’ has come to refer to a highly complex and pluralistic region of over 660 million people, 25,000 islands, and 150 ethnolinguistic communities. With its national identities formed from the encounter with and struggle against American, British, French, Dutch, Hispanic, Indian, Japanese, and Chinese influence, Southeast Asia’s movies have served as venues for propaganda and resistance. This course looks at how the remediations of different genres such as noir, melodrama, western, and sci-fi tackle controversial issues of gender, race, religion, poverty, migration, and the environment. Instead of smoothening the continuity of official historical narratives, it uncovers how documentaries, epics, and horror reexamine the trauma of past colonization, authoritarianism, and violence. To conclude, the course explores how television serials, anthology films, and online databases trace nascent cross-border and intra-regional communities beyond the limits of sovereignty."
"(UGEC3483 is double-coded with CURE3034.) This course aims to introduce Korean society and culture through Korean Popular Culture in relation to media and cultural studies scholarship and its socio-cultural contexts. In particular, we will examine the meaning of media and culture and its social changes in contemporary Korea through exploring various emerging trends and cultural studies as methodological tool within modern and contemporary Korean issues. Global popularity of Korean popular culture and the transnational Hallyu (Korean Wave) boom continue to percolate beyond Asia and inspire various critical questions regarding trans-nationalism, cultural imperialism and musical authenticity and hybridity. The course readings engage wide range of various issues and arguments of media and cultural studies scholarship as methodological tools; such as cultural representation, meaning of hegemony, cultural industry/economy and globalism of media, post colonialism, audience of mass media and fandom culture, gender and queer issues, and then further focus on the specific context of Korean popular culture including the pivotal notions of colonial modernity, Japanese imperialism, cultural hegemony in colonial Korea, meaning of Americanization, issues of popular memory and decolonization discourses, nationalism and globalization and Korean Wave, body/gender/sexuality / LGBTQ issue in Korean Media and Popular culture, cyber culture and internet memes, transnationalism and diaspora issues and its aftermath.

"Contemporary art has emerged as a privileged domain for exploring interspecies relations where various contemporary issues intersect. Thus, this course aims to introduce contemporary art and its representational aesthetics to consider various socio-cultural issues regarding art circulation and its interpretation, the connotation of contemporary art in society. The works of various contemporary artists will be presented in the context of focal issues that invoke social practices, conventional modality of contemporary art scene, shifting art interpretation within the norms and values in a society, relational art and public engagement, experimental use of media. In each week we will analyze contemporary art with specific themes, emphasizing the recurrent motifs and issues in contemporary art and its politics of representation, such as situation and activism, space, ruin and urbanity/modernity, trauma and memory in history, animality and non-human subjectivity, post-human and prosthetic body, gender and sexuality, queer art, magic (the material culture of the weird and eerie, ghost and monstrous iconography), cuteness as a concept reflecting from the contemporary popular cultural reference. Close readings in both academic and art critical practices, class discussion and participation will culminate in a final individual research paper interrogating the implications of representational tactics and strategies of a single artist and/or artwork in contemporary art."

"This course investigates the complicated relationship between ages-old Islamic tradition and modernity as exemplified most by the rise of secular politics. We will first focus on this problematic by tracing a particular set of questions through which knowledge about Islam and Muslim politics has been produced. By reading excerpts from scholarly works and influential media outlets, by watching documentaries, and through discussions during the class, we will develop a framework in which to recognize, understand and appreciate the gamut of political predicaments that Islamic tradition and its practitioners face under modern conditions. By the end of the first half of this course, students are expected to develop the ability to engage the following questions: What kind of assumptions about Islam and politics inform popular discussions on this topic? How has the rise of modern state power shaped and reshaped Muslims’ understanding of their tradition? What forms of lives, histories and struggles can and cannot be captured by this problematic? We will then spend the last several weeks exploring case studies that are considered to be paradigmatic of Islamic politics today. We will look at such historical and contemporary controversies as the Iraq War, the Arab Spring, the rise of ISIS, and the Jamal Khashoggi affair. In each given case, we will trace various ways in which the questions we addressed in the first half of the course continue to inhabit the narratives about how a supposedly “authentic” Islam figures in Muslims’ search for political and cultural legitimacy in modern times. Thus, the course does not aim so much to provide a survey of Muslims politics, but to develop a critical perspective on the key concepts and images that frame Muslims’ and non-Muslims’ discussions about the convergence between Islam and modern politics."
"This course introduces students to the study of religion, art and visual culture. Through visible expression and form in religious art across human history, we will explore the questions including: (1) how human beings see the world religiously? what does it mean to see the world religiously?

The English translations of Chinese religious novels like Wu Cheng'en's The Journey to the West and Cao Xueqin's The Story of the Stone will also be analyzed."
"The Union Version of the Bible (1919) constitutes an important factor in shaping modern Chinese literature and the vernacular movement in the early twentieth century. A large number of works of May Fourth writers (such as Lu Xun, Bing Xin and Xu Dishan) are filled with biblical images, themes, allusions and quotations. Meanwhile, many Chinese translations of the Bible are heavily influenced by the Chinese cultural and literary traditions. For instance, Yan Fu’s translation of the Gospel of Mark employs an elegant style of classical Chinese, while Wu Jingxiong’s Psalms adopts the refined forms of Shijing (The Book of Songs) and Chuci (The Songs of Chu). This course aims to examine the intricate interactions between Chinese literature and the Bible, particularly the influences of Chinese literary traditions on the translations of the Bible and the rhetorical influences of the Bible on the emergence of modern Chinese literature, with a view to widening students’ perspectives in the interdisciplinary study of literature and religion."
"Chinese novels have long been intertwined with religion. While Confucian, Buddhist and Daoist thoughts permeate classical Chinese novels, a large number of modern Chinese novels are peppered with Christian elements. As a lively epitome of Chinese religious culture, these novels also promoted the spread of religious thoughts among the people. This course aims to investigate the interactive relationship between Chinese novels and religion. Students will be guided to examine the religious contents in novels and the ways in which religious thoughts shape the themes, narratives, characterization and language of the novels. Texts selected for reading include classical and modern novels, such as Strange Tales of Liaozhai, The Story of the Stone and The Journey to the West."
