"Water is a major formative factor and driving force of the physical and biological environment. Water also provides a logical link between biophysical environment and the society. This course introduces the hydrologic concepts, principles, and techniques that are necessary to understand the occurrence, distribution, and circulation of water that pervades, links, and drives various components and processes of the Earth System. Emphasis will be placed on the various components in the land phase of the hydrologic cycle, including precipitation, evaporation and transpiration, infiltration and soil physics, and surface and subsurface flow to streams. Special topics on hydrologic modeling and impact studies will also be addressed."
"This couse will be combined with lectures and group discussion on research proposal prepration, literture review and compilation, academic paper writing, academic report preparation, the organzation and management of academic meetings. Popular academic themes will be discussed in the lectures and discussions."
"Digital terrain modelling is important component of modern geo-spatial information technology. Natural terrain surface can be modelled using digital terrain models to form digital data sets that can further be used for terrain parameter derivation and feature interpretation, This subject aims to introduce students the basic concept of digital terrain modelling and analysis. Methods and techniques will be introduced for digital representation of 3-dimensional terrain surface and data structure of digital terrain data. The analytical tools and methods will also be introduced to derive terrain parameters and to extract geomorphic or terrain features from the terrain data. Applications of digital terrain modelling to hydrology soil, ecology and environment will also be discussed."
"This course provides an overview in the environmental information, public health, surveying, mapping, and interpretation of geo-survey for supporting the public management. The course topics covered the both sides: the principles, techniques and methodologies of environmental information, geo-survey, as well as the foundations of public management which has crucial relationship with policy-making. At the end of the course, students will have a comprehensive knowledge of geo-survey for supporting the public policy analysis and evaluation, hence the rational and efficient public management."
"The course introduces the basic knowledge of earth environmental model simulations. Numerical models serve as important tools for earth environmental research and operations. While the topic of earth environmental modelling is broad, this course will focus on the fundamental concepts of numerical modelling, such as temporal and spatial discretizations, parameterizations, model uncertainty and evaluation. Various components of earth system model will be introduced, including atmospheric general circulation model, regional climate model, weather prediction and land surface model, oceanic general circulation model, air quality model, health assessment model and integrated assessment model. In addition, this course will discuss numerical model design, application and testing. Practical exercises such as weather forecast and air quality prediction are also provided for students to gain technical skills and hands-on experience in modelling."
"This course provides an introduction of a wide spectrum of spatial analytical models and their applications in environment, health, and public management. The course has two major aims. On the technical front, this course aims to teach students fundamental concepts and recent progress of spatial analysis. On the substantive front, this course integrates the introduction to spatial analytics with their applications in environment, health, and public management, ranging from mapping the inequality among economic and health outcomes, to environmental quality evaluation and innovative census using remote sensing and locational based service. After completing this course, students are expected to have a sound working knowledge of GIS and spatial data analysis and an ability to identify and apply proper analytical methods to problem solving, and to correctly and appropriately interpret and present analysis results."
"This course is for students intending to gain fundamental knowledge in the discipline of public health. General basic concepts, theories and methodology and scopes of public health practice will be introduced, with some emphases on occupation/environment and health risk assessment. Other important public health topics including air pollution, climate change, food sustainability, water pollution and land use, as well as health promotion and intervention in the community, healthcare management and policy implications."
"This course is to inform, explain, analyze, interpret and communicate the role of Geoinformation technologies in risk and crises situations (tsunamis, earthquakes, fires, landslides, anthropogenic disasters) and improvement of their use in adequate operations with aim to show their till now under-evaluated potentials and way how to integrate knowledge of cartographic and geographic community to risk and crises management into wide decision making process."
"The course helps students to understand remote sensing principles and basic skills in remote sensing image processing and analysis. The students will develop the capability to solve practical problems in the Earth System Science by using remote sensing methods. The theory, methods, and applications of environmental remote sensing are taught in the course. The lectures cover the principles of electromagnetic radiation, satellite observation sensors, digital image processing, Earth target classifications, and the remote sensing applications in land and ocean. ERDAS Imagine software will be used for lab practices."
"This course describes broad principles of Environmental Sensor Network (SN), the integration with positioning technologies and its roles in contemporary environmental studies and smart cities developments. The integration of SN and positioning technologies offers a powerful combination of distributed sensing capacity, real time data visualization and spatial analysis and integration with remote sensing data sources. The combined technologies are greatly needed in large-scale environmental monitoring and Smart Cities developments. Another half of the course introduces the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and other indoor positioning technologies. It covers the basic principles, advanced techniques as well as their applications in Earth System Sciences and urban management. With the background knowledge and the practical skills, students shall be able to integrate GNSS and SN in their future research and studies."
"Earth System Science is a study of the Earth as an integrated system with its major components of atmosphere, hydrosphere lithosphere and biosphere. This seminar course is an open forum which aims at making students acquire up-to-date knowledge and techniques of the Earth system and Geoscience. Well-known scholars, professionals, rescarchers and officals from local institutions and from overseas will be inivited to present their latest research and timely topics relevant to Earth system science."
Each student is required to carry out an independent research project under the supervision of a teacher.
"In this course, a student is required to meet with his/her supervisor regularly who provides necessary guidance and supervision to write up a thesis and monitors the student's academic progress."
