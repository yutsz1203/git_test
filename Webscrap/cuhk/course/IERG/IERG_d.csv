The focus will be on advanced topics like permissionless blockchain, Ethereum, smart contract, mining pool, permissioned blockchain, anonymity, new consensus, sidechain, ripple, offchain and lightning network.Advisory: Students are expected to have solid foundations on operating systems and database systems."
"Computational imaging systems are novel cameras that are combinations of optics, sensors, electronics,and algorithms that jointly enable new approaches for smart visual sensing and perception. It has a wide variety of applications in consumer electronics, autonomous driving, robotics, remote sensing, medical imaging, human computer interaction, machine vision, and scientific imaging. This course will cover core ideas and advanced topics of computational imaging systems and algorithms, including camera and image sensor models, high dynamc range imaging, coded imaging systems (aperture, exposure, illumination), burst photography for low-light imaging, 3D imaging, plenoptic functions and light field, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), compressive sensing, neuromorphic imaging, optical neural network, and more. Emphasis is on novel hardware and system design of computational cameras, as well as solving inverse problems with classic optimization algorithms and modern end-to-end learning-based methods. Students will learn the core principles of many computational imaging systems and implement key optimization-based and learning-based algorithms to solve inverse problems.Advisory note: It is preferred to have taken courses in deep learning and signal processing beforehand."
"The course will introduce to the students advanced topics in Information Engineering. The detailed course contents may be changed from year to year depending on the current development and the teacher specialty. Offerings with different subtitles can be taken for credit, up to a maximum of two times. This course is independent of IERG6130. Students can take either course or both.Advisory: Retaking the course for the 2nd time requires obtaining special approval from the course instructor before enrollment. The credit units completed will be counted toward the calculation of Term GPA as well as cumulative GPA no matter students pass or fail the course."
