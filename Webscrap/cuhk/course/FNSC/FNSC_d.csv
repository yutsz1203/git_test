"Community nutrition recognizes that the control and prevention of nutrition problems are not merely biomedical in nature, but are embedded in the community of the affected individuals. A community nutritionist assesses and monitors not only physiological and dietary, but also social, cultural, technological and psychological information from many sources to determine needs and identify opportunities for sound, appropriate interventions that improve nutritional health. Because well-conceived nutrition surveys are basic tools for prioritising problems and deciding program plans and evaluations to provide better nutrition services to the public, the course will first introduce community nutrition survey design to the students. Making healthier choices, however, requires lifelong change in thinking and action at both individual and community levels. The rest of the course examines applications of current individual and group nutritional behaviour change theories to promote healthier diets."
"Medical nutrition therapy examines the theory and practice behind the prevention and treatment of diseases with the help of diet. This course will introduce the etiology and dietary management of selected diet-related diseases including obesity; anorexia and other eating disorders; diabetes mellitus; cardiovascular diseases including hyperlipidemias; diseases of the alimentary canal, liver, kidney and gall bladder; pancreatitis; food allergy and cancer. It will also cover nutritional management for AIDS patients, interaction of drugs and nutrients, and aspects of dietary therapy in Chinese Medicine.
