"(UGEA1212 is double-coded with GRMD1003.)  This course aims to introduce China’s cultural heritages from the perspective of cultural geography. As an important sub-discipline in human geography, cultural geography examines how people use space and develop it into places – a process of cultural landscape formation. “Space” here is nothing immutable or monolithic; instead, individuals, groups, civilizations and their culture “craft” characteristic places through interactions with the surrounding environment and specific political and economic systems (themselves determined by culture). China provides numerous extraordinary examples to illustrate these topics. The course includes four key components: 1) the theoretical foundation: fundamentals of cultural geography; 2) the legacies and regional variations of China’s cultural heritages; 3) topical issues about China’s cultural heritages; 4) the cultural convergence in aspects of globalization and cultural transformation. The course provides not only a body of knowledge about the cultural landscape and spatial variations of places in China, but also an understanding of their major transformations that have taken place in a globalizing world."
"(UGEA1310 is double-coded with FAAS1600.) In light of artifacts whether excavated or collected as well as historical texts, this course provides an overview of Chinese art over 5000 years. Through studying the art and culture of the pre-historic era and the Bronze Age, and the development of painting, calligraphy, religious sculpture, architecture, jade, gold, silver, and ceramics throughout the centuries, students will understand the special characteristics and historical development of Chinese art and culture over the centuries. Artistic exchange between China and its neighbouring countries will be given special attention. Tutorial sessions involve practical workshop or the study of actual art objects at the Art Museum."
"This course introduces students to an understanding of the changes of the ethnic landscape in China from the past to the present. Through close readings of ethnographies, viewing of videos, and fieldtrips, this class examines various topics in multiculturalism in China, including ethnic relations, global economy, religion pluralism, and cross-cultural romance and marriage, in the context of globalization. This course also compares multiculturalism in different Chinese societies and discusses the possible futures of PRC. Over the past decade, China has been committed to advance the UN’s 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda (17 Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs). This course also discusses to what extent the development in China meets these goals, particularly in the area of sustainable economic growth, social equality, and cultural inclusiveness."
"(UGEA1450 is double-coded with CURE1122.) The aim of this course is to help students understand the basic religious characteristics of Chinese culture and the relationship between religions and the daily life of Chinese people. It also helps students to appreciate the richness and diversity of the Chinese traditions and acquiring essential preparation for more advanced courses in the area of Chinese culture and religions. The course is divided under the familiar categories of Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, and Popular religion. These traditions are, by no means, discrete and mutually exclusive. It will be demonstrated that they overlap and interact with each other through a variety of confluences and conflicts. Students will also be introduced to some primary source of the Chinese traditions including both textual and fieldwork data."
"(UGEA1515 is double-coded with GPAD1073.) Since its birth in the late-19th/early-20th century, Chinese movies have provided a very rich pool of images and stories, real or fictional, through which political messages could be read, interpreted, constructed, and re-constructed. As politics is a reflection of culture, a systematic analysis of these movies will provide students with a “softer” way to understand the cultural context which shapes Chinese politics. After an introduction of the relationship between culture, movies, and politics, the course will examine how Chinese political culture could be read through Chinese movies produced under different political settings (Republican, Maoist, and post-Maoist China)."
"This course aims to introduce the history of interaction between China and its neighbouring states in Asia since the premodern time. This course adopts an interdisciplinary approach – including the perspectives of history, international relations, and Chinese culture – to understand China's subjective and objective position in the region. China had been regarding herself as the leader in East Asia until European Imperialism intervened in the 19th century which challenged the legitimacy of Sino-centric order. With the growing acceptance of China's resurgence, this course provides a systematic analytical framework for students to understand the contribution of such historical and cultural factors to China's foreign policymaking nowadays."
"With increasing interest and usage of traditional, complementary and integrative medicine (TCIM) worldwide, it is recognized that public education is a key to promote safe and effective use of TCIM in the community. The World Health Organization Traditional Medicine Strategy 2014-23 has specified the strategic direction of: 1. Ensuring consumers of TCIM can make informed choices about self-health care. 2. Promoting proper use of TCIM products and services. This course aims to serve as an education intervention for achieving these two goals. As the most important form of TCIM in China and Hong Kong is traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), this course aims to introduce the basic theory and practice of TCM to our students. In addition, it will also briefly introduce the cultural and philosophical aspects of TCM . We aim to empower informed healthcare choices by promoting awareness on TCM diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. As a secondary aim, this course serves as an introduction to TCM, such that students from the Faculty of Medicine (e.g. western medicine, nursing, public health and pharmacy) can gain a basic understanding on TCM, preparing them for future interprofessional learning and practice of integrative medicine."
"This course aims to provide a general understanding of traditional Chinese culture. It covers the following core topics: characteristics of Chinese culture; Chinese thought; and Chinese political, social, and economic life. Other topics may also be covered, such as Chinese religion, science and technology in traditional China, the Chinese intelligentsia, and so on."

"This course examines the special characteristics of Chinese culture in relation to the obstacles and the problems it has been facing in the process of modernization, and attempts to search for a direction for its future development."
"As an important component of Chinese culture, Chinese music not only functions as entertainment, it also reflects the political situation and the social vicissitudes of China. In order to include multiple perspectives on viewing Chinese cultural heritage, the course is designed to provide a broad exposure to Chinese music through a wide spectrum of topics, such as basic concepts, notation, important genres and repertoire. No previous musical training is required, however, students’ understanding of Chinese musical culture will be reinforced and broadened by the end of the course. In addition, students will also understand how music serves political and social functions in ancient and contemporary China."
"Music has existed in many forms throughout Chinese history. The characteristics of each style and genre are shaped by sociocultural, geographical, and historical contexts as well as changing definitions of what it means to be Chinese. Beginning with the notion that Chineseness and Chinese culture are changeable and malleable, this course introduces students to various forms of Chinese music performed and popularized in Chinese and Chinese-speaking communities and their relationship to the construction of Chinese identity and sociality. Students will not only learn to appreciate the nature of the ever-changing world of Chinese music but to listen to it with critical insights and to understand how it relates to its context. Rather than approaching Chinese music as fixed and unchanging tradition anchored in a lineal historical trajectory, this course will treat each genre as a unique product of its time and social ethos. Hearing music in social contexts is a dynamic and productive way to enhance students’ understanding of the evolution of Chinese culture, identity, and the construction of community. The final project will be a group collaboration analyzing aspects of a genre of Chinese music found in Hong Kong. No previous musical knowledge is required."
"The course introduces the philosophical thought of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism, so as to give students a deeper understanding of the roots of Chinese values and culture. As a cornerstone of Chinese culture, Confucianism contributes to the establishment of the human moral way by articulating a conception of humans as moral subjects. Taoism stresses the pursuit of an ideal life by understanding the changes of the universe, while Buddhism applies the concept of karma to show how the ultimate cause of human suffering lies in ignorance. Other Chinese philosophical thought such as Mohism, Legalism, and the School of Yin and Yang may also be covered."

"This course aims to provide a general understanding of traditional Chinese thoughts through some great debates in the development of Chinese culture. These great debates include various issues: man and heaven, human nature, individual and society, ethics and law, ideals of life, etc. The course is to be conducted in an argumentative approach, through lectures, readings,and particularly, debates and discussions, students will achieve a critical reflection on Chinese culture and its value for modern life."
"(UGEA2180 is double-coded with ANTH2410.)  This course provides an anthropological approach to examining Chinese culture and society. Some of the key questions we raise include: What does it mean to be Chinese? What role does culture play in being Chinese, and what constitutes Chinese society? Our emphasis is on the dominant cultural practices of societies around the world that render them ‘Chinese’. The course will also situate contemporary China historically within the world-system and examine the dramatic transformations it has undergone as a result of the post-Mao reforms beginning in the late-1970s. Because China has become the world’s most dynamic growth-engine since these reforms were launched, the Chinese experience offers itself as a case-study of the benefits as well as challenges thrown up by modern development. Since China has committed to implementing the 2030 development agenda, including Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as clean water, affordable clean energy, and climate action, this course will offer students the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the discourse of sustainability as articulated by the SDGs. But more than that, with specific reference to the experience of the People’s Republic of China in particular, the course will afford students the opportunity to reflect upon the apparent contradictions existing between what is understood to be ‘development’ on the one hand and ‘sustainability’ on the other."
"This course will introduce students to a variety of social science concepts and theories to analyse contemporary China from an integrated perspective. After taking this course, students should be able to grasp the current development in key areas of China including economic reform, political system and change, rural and urban development, social inequality, family and marriage, cultural and ideological issues, as well as other institutional developments."
"From a historical perspective, the course explores the origin and evolution characteristics of Chinese culture. Its contents analyse and describe the historical traditions and changes in Chinese politics, economy, society, religion, culture and education, as well as the relationship between Chinese tradition and modernisation."
"Demonstrating the history of changing relations between politics and religions in China, this course aims to analyse the historical process wherein important policies took form, which changed the entire socio-political structure. In class, students will be introduced to the ideology-religion-politics relationship in traditional China. Furthermore, they will learn how to explore and appreciate Chinese society and culture through a historical perspective."
"This course introduces four classical history books of ancient China: Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji), Standard History of the Han (Hanshu), Records of the Three Kingdoms (Sanguozhi) and Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government (Zizhi tongjian). It particularly analyses the historical contexts, purposes, genres, compilations, historical thoughts of these history books and the characteristics of the Chinese culture shown in them. Students are given close guidance to study the typical writings in these historical books to comprehend, analyse and appraise the essence of traditional Chinese historiography as well as the evolution and characteristics of history, politics, economics and society in the Chinese cultural heritage from multi-disciplinary and comparative perspectives, and reflect on the intellectual and cultural insights of these traditions into the contemporary society and life."
"This course examines the relations between Chinese culture and literature, enabling students to gain a critical understanding of the cultural content in Chinese literary works as well as the cultural contexts in which literary developments took place. Topics of discussion include the characteristic features of Chinese culture and literature, and the cultural factors that influence literary developments, such as language, philosophy, cultural fashion of the times and regional culture. Relations between the cultural background of major authors and their creative styles will also be examined."
"This course compares and contrasts traditional Chinese society and its modern development. In addition, it also seeks to understand and explain the transition between these two contrasting stages. The course will be organized along the line of the “from tradition to modernity” thesis, by way of which the institutional and cultural development in Chinese society can be re-examined in a comprehensive light, encompassing both their traditional formation and modern transformation."
"(UGEA2330 is double-coded with ANTH2760.) This course aims to give students a visual and integrated understanding of Chinese civilization and cultural development in mainland China through analysing China's material cultural heritage, mainly traditional villages, ancient cities and grottos, as well as ceramics, jade and bronze items. The course will discuss the ecological, economic and cultural meanings of the above cultural properties in China, examine the preservation, management and exploitation of cultural heritage, and analyse how China's heritage has been re-interpreted and reconstructed to suit current economic, social and political needs, including the development of tourism, and the construction of ethnicity, nationalism and Chinese identity."
"(UGEA2332 is double-coded with ANTH2420.) The remarkable economic emergence of China and Asia more broadly in recent decades has transformed many impoverished and largely agriculturally based societies into the most dynamic region of the contemporary world. China’s burgeoning aspirational middle classes, rapid urbanisation, time-space compression and the shift from command economies to de-regulated markets have had profound effects on people's everyday lives and the diverse cultural practices that have long shaped local livelihoods and community expectations. This course offers an introduction into anthropological approaches to the study of culture, modernity and globalisation in China and Asia more broadly. Relevant themes that have attracted anthropological interest include changing traditions and popular culture, adaptive custom and cosmopolitanism, migration and citizenship, identity politics and social movements as well as distinctive and emergent forms of governance in both collective and self-cultivating forms of expression. Drawing on a rich corpus of social theory and ethnographic research from anthropologists past and present, the course will provide students with conceptual and analytical tools to appreciate adaptive cultural practices in comparative terms, to review and appreciate the key anthropological debates and influential works in the study of modernity, and to introduce students to ethnographic approaches for researching and writing on modernity and contemporary ethnographies of global connection."
"China is looming large on the global scene and our everyday life. It is a rising power that is changing the world order. It is a land of promising opportunities that attract an immense amount of capital and talents from overseas. Not to mention that a large part of the stuff we consume is produced in China. However, China is still—at least nominally—a socialist country that continues to embrace one-party rule and political censorship. Through the holistic perspective of anthropology that gives equal emphasis on political, economic, social, cultural, and ecological factors, this course addresses a host of issues that are salient in understanding China and its position in the contemporary world. The anthropological perspective is particularly good at making sense of the macro-level issues through studying day-to-day details and processes in a small locale. This course starts with examining China's revolution-packed modern history and the making of the powerful Communist Party; topics covered include classical anthropological themes on family, kinship, religion, education, ethnicity, identity, and morality. In the second half of the semester, this course examines emerging social concerns to explore how global processes such as modernization and late-capitalist development shape Chinese cultural and social institutions. These concerns include consumerism, individualism, urbanization, underground (unofficial) culture, civil society and activism, and financialization and digitalization. The course also draws from disciplines other than anthropology—for example, history—and some of the finest journalist writings on China. The overall intention is to provide a well-rounded and nuanced understanding of China today. The course prepares students for the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Anthropology has a strong heritage concerning inequality, marginalized group, human and environment, and wellbeing for all. Analyzing China, this course aims at understanding the development and choices of human beings. Therefore, the course will improve students’ reflection on several SDGs including “promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth,” “reducing inequality within and among countries,” “sustainable consumption and production patterns,” and “peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development and providing access to justice for all.”"
"(UGEA2433 is double-coded with CHES2107.) Science and technology in China from antiquity to the present is surveyed through the study of selected topics in some depth. Particular emphasis is given to science and technology as a window to appreciate certain aspects of Chinese culture and history. Two important questions are explored through contrasting China with the West: the conditions for the development of modern science and the central role of science and technology in modernization.Specific topics include the following: (1) history of science and technology in the West as background; (2) scientific thought and concepts of nature in ancient China; (3) traditional Chinese mathematics; (4) traditional Chinese astronomy; (5) Chinese medicine: history, philosophy, theory and practice; (6) innovation and progress in pre-modern Chinese technology; (7) early introduction of western science by missionaries and the Needham question; (8) science and technology in the Self-Strengthening Movement and the May Fourth Movement (‘Mr Science’); (9) science and technology from 1949 to the 1980s; (10) innovation and technology since the 1980s."
"Chinese novels have long been intertwined with religious culture. The Confucian, Buddhist and Daoist thoughts permeate classical Chinese novels. As a lively epitome of Chinese religious culture, these novels also promoted the spread of religious thoughts among the people. This course aims to investigate the interactive relationship between Chinese novels and religion. Students will be guided to examine the religious contents in novels and the ways in which religious thoughts shape the motifs, characterization, language and narrative structure of the novels. Texts selected for reading include masterpieces of Chinese novels, such as The Story of the Stone, The Journey to the West, The Investiture of the Gods and Strange Tales of Liaozhai."
