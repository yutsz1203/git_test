"This course covers the basic concepts of phonetics and phonology, with special reference to the sound system and phonological features of the English language. Course content includes: 1) the articulatory and auditory aspects of the English sound system covering both segmental and suprasegmental features; 2) phonological rules 3) phonemic representations and transcription systems; 4) phonological processes underlying speech acquisition and production, and 5) key differences between English and Cantonese phonology. Throughout the course, participants will be guided to consider the pedagogical implications of the concepts covered."
"This course covers major linguistic concepts of the English morphological and syntactic systems. Participants will be introduced to corpora of spoken and written English for the understanding and conceptualizing of the meaning and forms of words at sentence and discourse levels. Course content includes 1) basic concepts of linguistic treatment of the morpho-syntax of the English language; 2) form and meanings of grammatical/ syntactic and lexical constructions and their relationships with the context of use; 3) syntactic behaviour associated with the word such as tense, aspect, mood, transitivity and voice as well as gender, number, person and case; 4) word knowledge such as denotation, connotation, collocation, lexical sets and semantic fields, sense relations, synonymy, antonymy, hyponymy and meronymy; and 5) implications for teaching and learning."
"Through a study of discourse conventions of written and spoken language, participants will be introduced to some of the techniques for deconstructing connected speech and writing. Analysis of the structure of discourse, its phonological and orthographic rules, rhetorical structures and pragmatic conventions, will build awareness of how spoken and written language differ in substance and in style, how coherence and cohesion is achieved in speech and in writing, and how speakers and writers address themselves to an audience."
"This course will examine the psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic aspects of language. In terms of psycholinguistics, course content will examine the relationship between cognition, cognitive development and language; the stages, processes, and roles that affective factors play in first- and second-language acquisition. This course will also introduce sociolinguistics and study the ways in which groups of people use language, examining the close intertwining between a language and the social context in which it is used. Bilingualism and bilingual education in different contexts will be examined, with particular reference to Hong Kong. Aspects of language variation and dialects, societal bilingualism and multilingualism, language and power, and language policy and planning issues, together with the function of the second language and principles underlying the use of English as a medium of instruction in Hong Kong will also be covered."
"Literature and non-utilitarian texts can introduce living language and bridge the gap between communicative language teaching and culture. Interaction with texts leads to multi-level interpretations of meaning, affective responses, and exploration of cultural and aesthetic values. This course aims to build understanding of the skillful uses and manipulation of language to achieve a variety of effects in prose and poetry as well as in public speeches, advertising and journalism: it aims to open up for the language teacher a diversity of linguistic resources to enrich the curriculum."
"From time to time, courses focusing on area of English language or English language teaching not already covered in the regular programme of studies will be offered. These topics will reflect professional needs or interests and staff expertise."
"This course covers basic principles associated with English language assessment in Hong Kong as well as the implementation and delivery of tests and modes of assessment in Hong Kong. Course covers: 1) important concepts such as reliability, validity, practicality and washback; 2) different test types; 3) test types used in present and past assessment practice – investigating issues such as psychometrically-oriented testing versus a more communicative approach as well as current alternative modes to assessment such as portfolios and school-based assessment; and 4) the setting and marking of tests and other modes of assessment. Participants will be encouraged to consider the different modes of assessment in the light of their own students and developments in the changing assessment scene in Hong Kong."
"This course will examine the background and implications of recent policy initiatives, research or key projects in English and/ or English language teaching in Hong Kong or overseas. The purpose of the course is to enable participants to reflect upon recent developments as these may affect or impact upon the English language teaching profession in general and their own teaching situation in particular. Typically the course would be delivered by speakers who are at the forefront of their area."
"This course will examine the theoretical bases for reading and writing in the light of current perceptions of the processes and strategies involved in the two areas, exploring recent developments and models of second language reading and writing, and the pedagogical impact of these developments. Course participants will be encouraged to reflect on their classroom practice in helping second language learners develop the communicative competence necessary for appropriate and successful written English. The course will also focus on the what and the how of teaching reading and writing."
"This course will review the theories and approaches related to listening and speaking. Course content will cover an analysis of the different processes and strategies that speakers and hearers employ as they listen or speak with reference to their interlocutors, the discourse context and process features associated with the particular skill. The course will also examine ways of helping local students to become more proficient in listening and speaking with reference to current second language acquisition theories."
"This course covers the application of information and communication technology (ICT) for English language teaching in the light of the history and development of IT generally, and for computer-assisted language learning (CALL) specifically, over the past few decades. The course will look at the development of ICT in terms of the hardware and software available generally (as general-purpose software) or specifically for CALL. The course will examine the use of The Internet for computer-mediated communication such as email, chat programs and bulletin boards. Apart from standalone uses, the course will examine how ICT may be integrated into the broader language curriculum. Other issues covered will be ICT for teachers’ language development, for language research and the use of ICT in assessment."
"The course aims to develop participants' understanding of and experience associated with professional development in teaching English as a second language teaching (ESL). Participants will explore how to apply this knowledge and insight in sustaining their own professional development and to enable them to become more effective language teachers by taking increased responsibility for their own professional development. Topics covered will include: definitions and concepts of professional development; types of professional development, individual differences and their influence on professional development; the theory and practice of professional development; strategies to enhance and support professional development. The course will also examine ways of helping local ESL teachers to engage in professional development with reference to current professional development theories. Course participants are required to engage in a series of professional development activities, with a major focus on improving the teaching and learning of ESL writing, thus enabling them to contribute to an established sustainable professional development model."
"In their second year, with the guidance of a supervisor, students may conduct a small-scale project investigating one significant issue related to English language or to English language teaching. In principle, this project may have the focus of a survey, an experimental study or a case study. Students will have to complete a report of their piece of research according to a standard format. Projects will generally be done on an individual basis, but with the permission of the supervisor it may be possible for up to three students, as a group, to conduct one substantial project."
