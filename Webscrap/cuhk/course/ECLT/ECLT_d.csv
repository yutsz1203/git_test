"The objective of the course is to allow students to acquire a basic understanding and the skills of the practical aspects of E-Commerce and Logistics Technologies. To qualify for the award of the subject credits, the student must attach to a company in an E-Commerce and Logistics Technologies related post as approved by the Professor-in-Charge for no less than 12 weeks. The student will have an academic supervisor as assigned by the Professor-in-Charge and an industry supervisor from the company. There will be a mid-term company visit by the academic supervisor. At the end of the internship, the student must give a presentation to the academic and industry supervisors, and submit a report summarizing what the student has done and learnt from the internship. The student's grade will be determined by (1) the presentation, (2) the student report and (3) a testimonial from the industry supervisor.The internship should normally take place in the summer term after a student has finished the first two semesters of studies. Part-time students can decide to undertake the internship in the summer term of either the first or second year of studies.Students are recommended to seek the Professor-in-Charge's comment on potential internship opportunities before enrolling in the course."
