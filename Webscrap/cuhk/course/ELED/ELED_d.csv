"This is the first course of a series of three related courses on practices and techniques of teaching English in Hong Kong schools. These three courses seek to help students develop their theories and practices of language pedagogy and awareness of options available in the language classroom, make informed decisions in the planning and teaching processes and reflect on their teaching styles. Throughout the three courses, special attention will be paid to English language teaching pedagogy for current local curricular developments. These courses will include opportunities for observation of videotaped lessons and peer teaching. The first course focuses on developing the general competency, knowledge, strategies and skills a teacher needs in order to organise effective learning in the language classroom under the aegis of a communicative approach to language teaching and learning. A wide range of techniques and teaching strategies suitable for learners of different ages, proficiency levels and learning needs will be included. Topics include lesson planning, motivating, engaging and interacting with learners, classroom organization and management, dealing with errors, classroom language and using and evaluating learning materials. Teaching of grammar and vocabulary will also be covered."
"This course focuses on the teaching of listening and speaking skills. It is designed to develop students' knowledge, strategies and skills for teaching listening and speaking to learners of different proficiency levels and learning needs. The theoretical basis for current practice and the 'how' and the 'what' of teaching these two skills will be examined, demonstrated and practised. Teaching of pronunciation and phonics will also be covered."
"This course focuses on the teaching of reading and writing skills. It is designed to develop students' knowledge, strategies and skills for teaching reading and writing to learners of different proficiency levels and learning needs. The theoretical basis for current practice and the 'how' and the 'what' of teaching these two skills will be examined, demonstrated and practicsed. Teaching of integrated skills will also be covered."
"This course presents the basic principles of language assessment and current practices. It aims to develop a sound understanding of theoretical foundations and key issues of second language assessment, equip students with knowledge and practical skills in language test design, and provide opportunities to evaluate and critique language tests."
"This course provides an introduction to classroom-based research, with a view to sensitizing students to the complexity of language learning in the classroom, and equipping them with the skills of collecting and analysing language teaching and learning data. Major research methods in language teaching, in particular action research, are covered. Under the guidance of a supervisor, students will develop a research proposal during the course and collect data during their teaching practice."
"This course builds on the prerequisite course entitled ‘Studying Second Language Learners and Classroom’, which provides an introduction to classroom-based research. Course participants have already prepared a research proposal for the prerequisite course. Under the guidance of a supervisor, they will undertake the research project that they have proposed during the teaching practicum and submit a report on the study for course assessment. The aim of the two courses is to provide course participants, who are student teachers of English as a second language, an opportunity to conduct a study in the classroom for a better understanding of the teacher, the learners and classroom teaching and learning."
"Given that effective instructional materials are able to enrich learning experience and enhance learners' attention engagement in classrooms, this course aims to equip students with the principles and skills of materials development (materials design, selection, adaptation and evaluation) for ELT through lectures, group discussions and workshops. The following topics will be included: (a) an overview of different language learning models and instructional principles for formulating materials design principles that suit students' future teaching contexts; (b) the relationship between instructional methods, syllabus, and instructional materials; (c) the use of ELT instructional materials such as text books, authentic materials and multimedia materials; (d) materials selection, adaptation and evaluation. Throughout the course, students will be provided with practical experience of evaluating and adapting text books, and designing tasks requiring the use of authentic / multimedia materials in classrooms."
"This course covers the application of computers and associated technology for English language teaching, providing an overview of the uses of Computer Assisted Language Learning in schools. Topics include English language teaching software evaluation, interactive instructional technologies, multimedia, the Internet in English language teaching, and English language teaching curriculum applications. The major emphasis is on determining the needs / applications of computers in English language teaching in Hong Kong schools. Participants in the course are provided with hands-on experience in using and evaluating English language teaching software."
"This course examines recent policy initiatives, curriculum developments, research or key projects in English and / or English language teaching in Hong Kong or overseas. The background and implications of these issues on the teaching and learning of English will be analysed. Ways to address these issues at the school and classroom levels will also be explored."
"The course is designed to develop an appreciation of the central and emergent ideas in curriculum theory as it relates to English language teaching. Students examine the characteristics and assumptions of various types of language syllabuses. The course also critically reviews the processes of syllabus construction (e.g., needs analysis, content selection, sub-division, grading and sequencing) as well as curriculum implementation, management, and evaluation. Case studies of curricular problems in Hong Kong are analysed."
"This course examines the place of language arts in the English language curriculum and focuses on methods and techniques through which language arts can be used to enhance students' English language skills within a communicative approach to language teaching and learning. A wide range of genres including drama, novels, short stories, poems, films, songs, etc. will be covered."
"This course introduces a range of language activities that supplement the coursebook and the formal curriculum. Such activities help to enliven the learning experience, provide exposure to authentic language, and create opportunities for communicative language use. Example sources are the mass media, songs and rhymes, communication games, and leisure reading materials. Extra-curricular activities that provide enjoyable learning experiences include drama, debating, publishing, choral speaking, etc."
From time to time the Faculty will offer courses that will focus on an area of English language teaching that is not already covered in the regular programme of studies. These topics will reflect professional needs / interests and Faculty expertise as well as addressing new developments in English language teaching in Hong Kong.
