"This course focuses on the communication skills required for communicating with patients with nervous system diseases, modes and skills of making presentations, writing of scientific reports and critical analyses. It will also cover basic principles of clinical and laboratory research in brain diseases, literature search and ethical issues in relation to such investigations."
"This course covers Alzheimer’s disease, other dementing illnesses, Parkinson’s disease, prion disease and multiple sclerosis. It will cover the aetiology, pathogenesis, pathological features, principles of management and recent scientific advances of these diseases."
"This course starts with the scientific principles of neoplasia and molecular and genetic pathogenesis of cancer. It will then cover the very broad groups of tumours that can occur in brain and spinal cord. It will include the pathology, molecular pathology, neuro-imaging features, principles of surgical and medical treatment of these tumours, as well as the recent scientific advances of brain tumours."
This course starts with an introduction of the embryology of the brain and spinal cord and essential neuro-histology. It will then move on the basic concepts of stem cells and the different types of stem cells resident in the body. The teachers will illustrate with a number of diseases how stem cells can be used in the future to understand diseases and potentially used in the treatment of some incurable diseases.
This course deals with the diverse groups of diseases that may present with muscle weakness in the adult and pediatric age groups. It will also cover peripheral neuropathology. Both clinical and pathological aspects will be dealt with. The course ends with an introduction to ophthalmic pathology and the relation of eye diseases to nervous system diseases.
"The students will attend a series of lectures by international experts of brain diseases, usually as part of an international conference held in Hong Kong in which the students will attend. An assessment will be made afterwards."
"The course starts with concept of epilepsy, followed by lectures covering common associated brain pathology, classifications, investigations including Electroencephalography (EEG), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) and Magnetic Encephalograme (MEG), and neuropsychology assessment. The course highlights the interpretation and integration of various information into clinical management including epilepsy surgery."
"The course covers brain and spinal cord injury in aspects of pathology, pathophysiology, neuro-radiology and clinical management. Advance in research in neuro-trauma will also be introduced."
"This module aims to provide a board interdisciplinary training in diseases related to cerebral vasculature. Students will study molecular, pathological, radiological, clinical, medical, surgical, and rehabilitation aspects of common cerebrovascular diseases. Cognitive science and biostatistics related to clinical research will also be covered. Practical sessions on transcranial Doppler ultrasound and computed tomography angiography / perfusion will be included."
"The course starts with developmental characteristics of children in the nervous system, followed by developmental assessment and paediatric neurological examination as well as paediatric neuro-imaging. The course focuses on common neurosurgical and neurological disease in children and the principle of management. Recent advancement in paediatric neurosurgery and neurology will be introduced."
"The students should conduct an independent study in brain diseases. The research may form part of a team effort to study a particular aspect of a disease but each student must make an independent report of his / her own work. Research can be in the format of laboratory investigations or a detailed clinical study, including novel descriptions of series of cases. In all instances, there must be a critical review of the literature and an original contribution to the knowledge of that disease."
