(UGEC1681 is double-coded with ANTH1010.) This course discusses the nature and development of humans and culture. Examples from different cultures in the past and the present will be used to illustrate the similarities and variations among human groups.
"This course introduces students to the basics of anthropology and its role within the humanities, and its relevance to modern-day society. It addresses the basic question of ""why people do what they do"": how our cultural and social shaping in large part makes us what we are as human beings. The course focuses on the similarities and differences in human societies and cultures, in order to promote a fuller and deeper understanding of the nature and meaning of being human in today's world."
"Through small-group tutorials and discussions, students are guided to understand better how anthropologists work and how anthropological knowledge can be relevant to people’s lives. At the same time, the teacher gets to know the students better, and can thus provide them with better counselling. The course is only offered to major students. Non-Major student who is interested to take this course can seek a consent from the Department."
"(UGEC1625 is double-coded with ANTH1310.) This course invites students to explore the issue of gender cross-culturally through the framework of kinship. It introduces basic concepts and major issues in the areas where the study of gender and the study of kinship intersect through an anthropological lens. Issues to be explored include kinship structures and related gender roles in cross-cultural perspective, the changing relationship between marriage and love, and the various new ways of people “doing” kinship in contemporary societies and the emerging social problems resulted from these changes. Themes such as kinship and the new reproductive technologies, fictive kinship and human-pet bond will all be discussed."
"(UGEC1835 is double-coded with ANTH1410.)  This course introduces students to characteristic aspects of Hong Kong culture. It will cover a wide range of cultural changes that have taken place since WWII. The course starts with an introduction to anthropological research in Hong Kong, and looks at topics including village culture and urbanization, food culture, marriage, family and gender, religion, and popular culture. Underlying most topics are questions of the modern versus the traditional, rural versus urban, cosmopolitan versus parochial, and how all these opposites interact to construct culture in Hong Kong. Hong Kong has been developed at a rapid pace since WWII. This course also discusses to what extent the development in Hong Kong meets the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular in the area of gender equality, cultural inclusiveness, and socially responsible production and consumption."
"(UGEC1633 is double-coded with ANTH1710.) This course aims to provide students with some basic understanding of archaeology. It will introduce the basic theory, method and practice of archaeology. It will focus on the nature and development of archaeology, data acquisition (archaeological surveys and excavations), data processing and analysis, synthesis and interpretation (reconstruction of the past environmental ecology, economic, social and cultural life) and important archaeological discoveries and studies around the world. The significance of archaeology to contemporary societies will also be discussed."
"The course provides a historical overview of the major schools in anthropology: cultural evolutionism, functionalism, historical particularism, structuralism and cultural interpretation will be discussed."
"The course provides an in-depth analysis of contemporary anthropological theory including post-modernism, post-structuralism, practice theory, political economy, globalization, feminist anthropology and the material turn. It will introduce students to major figures in contemporary theoretical debates and key ongoing controversies in the discipline. The course will provide students a foundation for beginning to apply anthropological concepts and theories towards their own interests. ANTH2111 complements ANTH2110’s historical perspective on Anthropological Theory."
"This is a STOT course for second-year Major students. The course guides students in critically reading both classic and recent ethnographies of peoples in the world, so that they acquire the knowledge of the vast diversity of existent cultures, and of how politics, economics, religion and social organization interact with the environment in different ecological settings. Advisory: For Major students only."
"This course provides an introduction to basic anthropological research techniques, including: controlled observation, formal and informal interviewing, kinship recording, mapping, participant observation and life history. Students will be taught to design and conduct research projects."
"This course will introduce anthropological approaches to the study of the visual and pictorial world. Classic and recent ethnographic films will be shown, and students are guided to an anthropological understanding through pictorial media. Entertainment motion pictures and documentary films will also be analysed as an anthropological issue, especially in relation to such notions as ""culture"", ""otherness"" and ""reality""."
"(UGEC2653 is double-coded with ANTH2310.) This course looks at the relationship between gender and culture, by comparing women and men in societies with different modes of production and social organization. Through analysing gender roles, enculturation process, kinship, division of labour by gender, power and control and social development, students will understand how culture influences the concept of gender and its related behaviour among human groups."
"(UGEC2667 is double-coded with ANTH2320.) How can we understand the minds of other people? Do people in different cultures or societies feel and think in different ways? How do childhood experiences affect people and shape or even determine what kinds of persons they will become? What is it like to be mentally abnormal or even pathological? Do people in different cultures or societies experience, understand, and treat psychopathology in different ways? This course examines psychological experiences—feelings, perceptions, thoughts, and motivations—from social and cross-cultural perspectives. It sets out to explore the intersection between anthropology, a field that typically turns to the exotic other, and psychology, a field that often takes the universality of mental activities and mechanisms for granted. Specific focus is placed upon how ethnographers, clinicians, and researchers with training in both fields grapple with various mental phenomena and different ways of understanding them. As most of the materials are drawn from psychological anthropology, this course also serves as an eclectic introduction to this subfield, which was once influential in the history of American anthropology."
"(UGEC2654 is double-coded with ANTH2321.) This course examines mental illness and mental health as subjective experiences, social processes, and objects of scientific knowledge and practice. It invites students to explore human experiences that are labelled as abnormal or pathological, to understand the expert knowledge and technologies employed to remedy these conditions, and to think about the complex relationships between them and the broader social and cultural contexts. Readings are drawn from psychiatric anthropology or anthropology of mental health, clinical case studies, and memoirs. They are chosen to reflect an interdisciplinary scope that includes social sciences, psychiatry itself, and the layman’s/patient’s perspective."
"(UGEC2655 is double-coded with ANTH2324.) This course is an anthropological introduction to contemporary India, its social life and diverse cultures. India is home to more than a billion people, who look differently, speak various languages, practice different religions, and have distinct rituals, cuisines, and music. It is one of the world’s powers with global economic, political, and intellectual influence. Moreover, it shares important ties in the sphere of philosophy, religion, and medicine with China and other Asian societies. Therefore, students will learn about India’s place both in the world and the Asian region, including its ties with Hong Kong. Students will also develop an understanding of the country’s diversity and complex social phenomena such as kinship, communalism, caste system, tribe, third gender, and class. We will discuss pressing issues and theoretical debates related to globalization, sexuality, social movements, religious conflicts, public health, environment, and labor, and how these issues have been shaped by post-colonial politics and current transnational processes."
"(UGEC2970 is double-coded with ANTH2330.)  This course focuses on gender in the Asian region. A comparative approach will be taken to reflect diversity and resemblance, continuity and discontinuity, and historical and contemporary influences on gender within countries in the Asian region. Societies studied may vary from year to year, and may include Hong Kong, mainland China, India, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Chinese across societies. Gender issues and conditions will be examined within different contexts, covering such areas as language, class, work, family and kinship, health, sexuality, education, religion, development and politics."
"(UGEC2960 is double-coded with ANTH2340.)  This course will examine phenomena often viewed as irrational and superstitious to see how they can be understood in cultural terms. All societies have some beliefs in another world, yet beliefs vary widely between societies. The course will examine traditional anthropological topics such as magic, traditional healing, divination, fengshui, witchcraft, and ghosts, as well as more recent issues such as ESP, psychokinesis, qigong, vampires, zombies, monsters, UFOs and alien abduction. The role of myth in modern society and the cultural creation of reality will be highlighted. The power of a cultural approach in explaining the supernatural and the limits of what science can explain will also be discussed."
"(UGED2980 is double-coded with ANTH2350.)  In societies across the world, people have different culturally-shaped senses of what their lives mean: people may live for money, love, honour or fame; for family, company, country or religion. This course examines the processes through which meanings of life are formulated and maintained in day-to-day life in societies past and present; it also explores life meaning as a way of comprehending the evolution of human societies. The course uses the concept of ""meanings of life"" as a window into the anthropological understanding of cultural difference and cultural evolution."
"(UGED2669 is double-coded with ANTH2351.) Death is both a human universal and a process deeply affected by the cultural context in which it occurs. Dealing with death, both practically and psychologically, is something that all humans must face. This course examines death and death ritual through the question of what is universal and what is culturally variant about how humans face death. It looks at death and death ritual in both modern and pre-modern contexts and analyses it socially, psychologically, politically, and culturally. From the course students will learn how the treatment of death varies cross-culturally; how understandings of death have shifted over human cultural evolution; what aspects of death are universal in human experience; and how death affects contemporary politics, economics, and culture."
"(UGED2666 is double-coded with ANTH2360.) This course introduces students to the study of morality and ethics from a social and cross-cultural perspective. Morality and ethics became a distinct area for anthropological inquiry as recently as the beginning of the 21st century. Why this topic is relatively new in anthropology has something to do with the way in which moral differences have been conflated with cultural differences in the history of the discipline. In other words, anthropologists have long presumed that differences between right and wrong, good and bad, are culturally constructed. In recent years, however, this conflation has been questioned and problematized, with reference to the problem of competing moral goods within a single society and the role of the individual in negotiating moral commitments. Having much to say about cultural differences as well as contingent social processes, anthropologists are now in an even better position to contribute to cross-disciplinary conversations about the nature of morality and ethics. By exploring morality and ethics from a social and cross-cultural perspective, this course will demonstrate that morality and ethics is by no means an abstract subject best studied by philosophers. Students will be encouraged to see ethics as a part of their everyday lives, and to see the lives of others as shaped by shared human problems such as how to get along with other people, and how to get along with oneself. This course is divided into four major units. It begins with an issue highly relevant to university students: the responsibility individuals carry for their own success and self-fulfillment in capitalist societies. The second unit considers why moral and cultural differences have been conflated, and how different societies have responded to shared human problems in different ways. The third unit explores the relationship between morality and the creation and maintenance of social relationships. Case studies of small communities in different parts of the world will be especially helpful for understanding morality and ethics from a social perspective, as cooperation can be fragile yet so important in small communities. Topics and readings in the last unit offer resources for enriching and expanding our vocabulary of virtues. Students will be invited to conduct research into the mundane things ordinary people do to take care of one another in daily life."
"(GENA2362 is double-coded with ANTH2370.)Hong Kong, with its dominant image as an Asian global city as well as gateway to mainland China, has been representing itself with an image of East meets West for its tourist attractions in the last century. In order to maintain this image for its world visitors, there is no doubt that Hong Kong needs to find a balance between its global metropolitan aspect and unique cultural heritage with local characteristics in many ways. Yet, before moving on for extensive intangible heritage preservation, we might want to think about: What kind of heritage do we want to pass down to the coming generations? What kind of long-term policy do we have? How should the intangible heritage preservation and management be carried out? In this course, different types of intangible heritage in Hong Kong will be introduced and explained, and students will be guided to discuss and rethink the use and meanings of heritage from a socio-cultural anthropological perspectives."
"(UGEC2950 is double-coded with ANTH2380.)  This course pays attention to the environment and its relation with human experiences. Through the lens of environment, we bring human diversity into presence, examining ways of life of peoples—from Indonesia highlander to Tokyo urbanites—and their words and deeds to tackle crises of planetary scale—climate change, nuclear disaster, air pollution, waste, deforestation. Facing these crises, can anthropological inquiry of the environment help us to explore a humanity that can accommodate living beings of all kind? How can such inquiry inspire us to make changes that create a world we can live together? We’ll follow these trails in the environment to look for engagement and conversation: cultural perception on the origin of agriculture, resource use and religious belief, debating traditional ecological knowledge, globalization and state intervention, environmental justice, land dispossession, waste and pollution, disaster and extreme environment. Through ethnographies of people who are struggling to survive, this course asks why they are pushed into poverty, how their resources being exploited, what they do to fight for justice; it covers SDGs related to the issues of sustainable agriculture (SDG2), tacking climate change (SDG13) and promoting peace, justice and institutional accountability (SDG16)."
"(UGEC2664 is double-coded with ANTH2390.)This course will examine the role and importance of sports in different societies and cultures, in the present and the past. Sports are often thought of as trivial, or as unimportant games to amuse young people. But in the wealthiest countries, sports represent huge portions of GDP and are important topics of daily conversation. Almost half the world watched the 2010 football/soccer World Cup. Sports have been compared to religions in their ability to unite people and to inspire fanatical devotion.The academic study of sports is interdisciplinary, with contributions from psychologists, historians, gender studies scholars, sociologists and anthropologists. This course will take an interdisciplinary approach while emphasizing anthropology’s focus on culture, on the experience of participants, and on both symbolic and political-economy aspects of sports. Topics will include Race and Performance, Sports and Rituals, Sports as Moral Education, Gender and Sexuality in Sport, Sports and Nationalism, Globalization of Sport, the Olympics, and Sports Stars and the Media. Students will be expected to do a research project for the course."
"This course examines selected topics, both area-related and problem-oriented, within the field of ethnography. Semester offerings will vary with the instructor and may include such topics as regional studies, classic and contemporary ethnographic writings, and issues of the anthropologist and fieldwork."

"This class begins its study of Islam by examining the historical developments of Islam in pre-Islamic Arabia and looking at the life of various religious figures. It then examines aspects of Islamic civilization, culture and philosophy. Finally it addresses issues of the so-called ‘politicization of religion’ in the context of globalizing modernity and violent conflict. Throughout this course we will investigate the insights that anthropological analyses can offer to discussions centering the relations between Muslim societies and the West."
"(UGEA2180 is double-coded with ANTH2410.)  This course provides an anthropological approach to examining Chinese culture and society. Some of the key questions we raise include: What does it mean to be Chinese? What role does culture play in being Chinese, and what constitutes Chinese society? Our emphasis is on the dominant cultural practices of societies around the world that render them ‘Chinese’. The course will also situate contemporary China historically within the world-system and examine the dramatic transformations it has undergone as a result of the post-Mao reforms beginning in the late-1970s. Because China has become the world’s most dynamic growth-engine since these reforms were launched, the Chinese experience offers itself as a case-study of the benefits as well as challenges thrown up by modern development. Since China has committed to implementing the 2030 development agenda, including Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as clean water, affordable clean energy, and climate action, this course will offer students the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the discourse of sustainability as articulated by the SDGs. But more than that, with specific reference to the experience of the People’s Republic of China in particular, the course will afford students the opportunity to reflect upon the apparent contradictions existing between what is understood to be ‘development’ on the one hand and ‘sustainability’ on the other."
"(UGEA2332 is double-coded with ANTH2420.) The remarkable economic emergence of China and Asia more broadly in recent decades has transformed many impoverished and largely agriculturally based societies into the most dynamic region of the contemporary world. China’s burgeoning aspirational middle classes, rapid urbanisation, time-space compression and the shift from command economies to de-regulated markets have had profound effects on people's everyday lives and the diverse cultural practices that have long shaped local livelihoods and community expectations. This course offers an introduction into anthropological approaches to the study of culture, modernity and globalisation in China and Asia more broadly. Relevant themes that have attracted anthropological interest include changing traditions and popular culture, adaptive custom and cosmopolitanism, migration and citizenship, identity politics and social movements as well as distinctive and emergent forms of governance in both collective and self-cultivating forms of expression. Drawing on a rich corpus of social theory and ethnographic research from anthropologists past and present, the course will provide students with conceptual and analytical tools to appreciate adaptive cultural practices in comparative terms, to review and appreciate the key anthropological debates and influential works in the study of modernity, and to introduce students to ethnographic approaches for researching and writing on modernity and contemporary ethnographies of global connection."
"(GENA2332 is double-coded with ANTH2450.) The primary aim of this course is to introduce the peoples and cultures of Southeast Asia through anthropological studies. The course will highlight cultural similarities and differences, and explore the issues of ethnicity, development and national identity."
"(UGEC2662 is double-coded with ANTH2510.)  Culture is ubiquitous in every aspect of societies, including how we do business. This course will examine the role of culture in contemporary business and study work and management in industrial societies anthropologically. Students will be introduced to the cultural logics of business practices, particularly business operations, organization and management through ethnographic explorations of different cultures, locales and sociohistorical settings. The aims of the course are twofold. First, it reveals cultural aspects and the cultural mechanisms of business. It shows the significance of culture in the business world, as well as the cultural significance of business. Second, it attempts to put anthropology into business practice. It demonstrates to students how anthropological knowledge and methodologies can be applied to business operations and help to achieve business goals. By examining the themes including but not limited to the indoctrination of work ethics, labor relations, gender and racial issues in the workplace, capitalism and its discontents, and responses to and actions upon market capitalism in terms of both production and consumption, the course attends to these Sustainable Development Goals: No Poverty (SDG#1), Gender Equality (SDG#5), Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG#8), Reduced Inequalities (SDG#10), Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG#12), and Partnerships for the Goals (SDG#17)."
"(UGEC2990 is double-coded with ANTH2520.)  Globalization is economically transforming the world, as national borders become increasingly irrelevant before the global flow of money and goods. But globalization also has a great impact on cultures across the globe, as products from Coca-Cola to iPods, and ideas from human rights to ideals of beauty to ideologies of terrorism, intrude everywhere. This course examines how globalization is fundamentally transforming the meanings of culture. The course objectives are to enable students: (1) to have greater insight into the processes of “the globalization of culture""”, and (2) to better understand the nature of their own culture and selves within a globalizing world."
"(UGED2622 is double-coded with ANTH2530.)  This course examines the pervasiveness of violence from an anthropological and comparative perspective. We consider a wide range of phenomena that can be called violence within diverse historical and cultural contexts. Violence is always political – whether it is manifest in the spectacular practices of torture, terrorism, or genocide, or the invisible structures of inequalities that generate educational, health, and food inequities. Specifically, we will address four SDG goals in depth: SDG#1 No Poverty, SDG #5 “Gender Equality”, SDG# 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth, SDG #10 “Reduced Inequalities” and SDG #16 “Peace, Justice and strong institutions”; The topics covered will be understood in relation to histories of colonialism and nationalism, ideologies about race, gender, and variant forms of social, economic, and political hierarchies. We further examine the effectiveness and limitations of human rights and humanitarianism as remedies, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."
"(UGEC2665 is double-coded with ANTH2540.) This course addresses the ways in which social media and other related interactions in cyberspace have become a central element in the everyday lives of humans across the globe in the 21st Century. Our modern lives are now largely interwoven with digital technologies that have not only changed our own cultures, but also have brought forth new cultural forms through mobile phone technologies, networked “smart”-products, and cultural groupings only possible through digital means. The course approaches the anthropology of these digital cultures through its main themes—the transformation and expansion of social media, social research online, the intermixing of our online and offline lives, critical social issues of online lives, and the question of posthumanism. These themes are addressed explicitly in the course, and are also the subtexts of the different lectures, readings, and project work. Students will learn the techniques of online fieldwork and referencing. They will explore a diverse array of new ethnographies on social media: on gender, political movements, online dating, hacking, and gaming culture. These ethnographies also serve to model online social research and provide examples of methodology and design. The social consequences of cyberspace are addressed in the topics of internet pornography, addiction, surveillance, activism, and social networking. Gender and identity issues are a continuous theme throughout the course, highlighting how online lives accentuate already existing dynamics. Hong Kong connections to these subjects will also be critically discussed, often drawing on topical themes presented on blogs and forums. Students will learn of the philosophical questions of posthumanism and the nature of technologically mediated human culture. This serves as a philosophical ballast to the course allowing students to reflect personally on their own experiences and how technology has and will continue to shape their lives. The role of anthropology in understanding and capturing human culture in this context anchors on the investigation of how technology is possibly making us ‘more’ human than previous forms of cultural life."
"This course will discuss the history and development of Chinese archaeology, the subjects, research methods and theories of archaeology in mainland China, the formation of the Paleolithic and Neolithic cultures in China, and significant archaeological discoveries of the Bronze Age and historical periods. It will examine how archaeology is related to the construction of Chinese identity and nationalism, and related academic debates. It will also re-evaluate ancient Chinese civilization from the perspectives of ancient Asia and the world."
"This course will review major archaeological discoveries in Hong Kong, trace the arrival of the earliest Hong Kong inhabitants at around 6000 years ago, examine the succeeding cultural development, and discuss the material culture, social structures and beliefs of ancient Hong Kong. Cultural similarities and differences between ancient Hong Kong, South China and Southeast Asia will also be compared, and the significance of Hong Kong archaeology in the contexts of South China and Southeast Asia will be evaluated. The course will also address the management of archaeological remains in contemporary Hong Kong, and discuss the political and economic issues."
"(UGED2668 is double-coded with ANTH2730.) This course aims to give students the basic knowledge and training on cultural heritage preservation, including archaeological excavation, report and analysis, and the preservation of ancient architectures and monuments. The course includes the following topics: (1) concepts and international conventions/policies of cultural heritage preservation; (2) archaeological recording and analysis; and (3) preservation of ancient architectures and monuments: intangible and digital heritage standards and procedures."
"(UGEB2505 is double-coded with ANTH2740.) How we understand the past defines the way how we understand our current situation. Archaeology is a dynamic discipline that has tremendously expanded our knowledge about the past, but this subject is not just about digging and doing fieldwork. A wide range of new techniques (e.g., metallurgy, zoology, and 3d stimulation) and research methods have been incorporated into current archaeological research, and eventually transformed the understanding of ourselves and our culture in many ways. This course provides a general introduction in terms of two specific domains: 1) basic archaeological science that changed the research paradigm of human culture and history; 2) an overall history about ancient technology illustrated by new research techniques to explain how this modern world took shape. Moreover, this course provides hands-on practice to cultivate students’ cross-disciplinary research skills and prepare them for the arrival of a new, digitalized research era."
"(UGEA2330 is double-coded with ANTH2760.) This course aims to give students a visual and integrated understanding of Chinese civilization and cultural development in mainland China through analysing China's material cultural heritage, mainly traditional villages, ancient cities and grottos, as well as ceramics, jade and bronze items. The course will discuss the ecological, economic and cultural meanings of the above cultural properties in China, examine the preservation, management and exploitation of cultural heritage, and analyse how China's heritage has been re-interpreted and reconstructed to suit current economic, social and political needs, including the development of tourism, and the construction of ethnicity, nationalism and Chinese identity."
"(UGEB2502 is double-coded with ANTH2810.)  What does it mean to be human? Where did we come from? Where are we going? This course investigates long-term evolutionary perspectives on the human species. The basics of evolution and natural selection as scientific theories are clearly set out and examined, and common misconceptions discussed. Evidence for the evolution of mammals and primates is reviewed and discussed, and the common characteristics of these species are highlighted, demonstrating the connections between humans and other forms of life. The course covers what we know about human ancestors and the evolution of modern humans. Students are introduced to the wide range of human adaptations to local conditions across contemporary cultures and the variety of relationships that human populations have with the environment. Students are encouraged to use the knowledge they have acquired to ask: are these relationships always sustainable? Looking to the future: what are our responsibilities both to future generations of humans and towards other species with which we share our world? This course aims to give students an understanding and appreciation of evolutionary perspectives on the place of humans in the world, the variety of contemporary human societies, and a broad perspective on the complexity of the relationship between humans, the environment and other species."
"Interest in the field of forensic anthropology has been heightened in the last decade through the success of forensic-themed television shows and popular novels. This course will introduce students to the field of forensic anthropology – a scientific discipline that involves the application of methods from biological anthropology and archaeology to the identification, recovery, and analysis of skeletal remains from crime scenes, mass disasters, and unexplained death. Through lectures and in-class assignments, students will learn about the methods for recognizing and recovering evidence that allows for the determination of time since death, manner and cause of death, and the identification of individuals."
"Religious practices and beliefs permeate cultures throughout the world and religion has always been one of the most important topics in anthropology and liberal studies. This course examines the following aspects of religion: magic and sorcery, symbolism and ritual, gender and religion, shamanism, syncretism, and social change driven by religious ideas. The course also introduces major traditions of social theory: each tradition offers a different way of looking at the role of religion in people's lives. This course thus introduces students to various forms of religious expression around the world and also exposes them to different interpretations of religion."
"The content of this course varies from semester to semester, but concentrates either on selected problems related to the encounter with other societies through anthropological fieldwork, or on special issues in anthropological theory. Contents of this course will vary with instructors and students. Offerings with different subtitles can be taken up for credit, up to a maximum of two times."

"This course is an anthropological exploration of the social life and cultures of India. We will explore India through the lens of popular culture, caste and class, the politics of religion, gender/sexuality, nationalism and globalization. Students will be engaged in the contemporary theoretical debates relating to the socio-cultural change in modern India, enabling them to appreciate the complex nature of Indian culture and Indian nationality."
"This course examines the cultural phenomena of migration of populations, immigration across national boundaries, and the displacement of peoples and communities. This course uses the diaspora cultures, such as the ethnic Chinese, the Jewish communities and the ethnic Indians, to illustrate the history, structure, theory and politics of ethnic identity, ethnic relations, and cultural and national identity."
"This course will focus on the social implications and cultural meanings of food. Topics to be covered include: ecology, food and foodways, diffusion of food; cultural uses of food; table manners; social relations; gender and the construction of identities through food; food taboos and food symbolism; globalization and foodways; concepts of fitness, beauty and medical beliefs in the production and consumption of food; and food security."
"This course explores the relations between the body, love, and emotions from an anthropological perspective. People acquire a special sense of presence, knowledge, and power from the brute fact of their bodies as sentient, sensuous, instinctual, habitual, feeling, and erotic organisms. At the same time, this special presence has made the materiality of the body a contested site for representational practices and politics in which love and emotions have figured centrally. Through an ethnographic focus on cross-cultural studies of love and emotions, this course seeks to juxtapose and reconcile the body's manifold facets as materiality and representation, subject and object. We will address the following questions: What are the culturally differentiating politics and poetics of the seemingly universal emotion of love? What conceptions of the body and personhood do they articulate? How do modern notions of love and desire underscore changing gender relations, sexual identities, and embodied ideals of masculinity and femininity? How do affect and embodiment intersect with the problems of class, race, ethnicity, and nationality?"
"This course will examine, in the context of tourism, such issues as globalization and transnationalism, travel and border zones, the invention and representation of culture, the marketing of tradition, the commoditizing of culture, museums and heritage, authenticity and identity formation, and the quest of the industrialized nations for the folk, the exotic and the past."
"This course presents the political economy approach to the study of culture. It introduces the major topics of the subfields of economic and political anthropology, as well as the goals and dilemmas of applied anthropology. The course will examine the cultural evolution of societies, how culture shapes — and is shaped by — the production, distribution and consumption of goods, the flow and accumulation of power, and the nature of conflict and governance. The course will show how a holistic cultural approach can improve our understanding of power and the economy, and how only by considering power and material life can we fully understand culture."
"Disability may appear to be a brute fact, a form of difference readily apparent in a person’s body or behavior. But is this necessarily the case? The study of disability from an anthropological perspective is in fact a study of difference, that is, how categories of difference are made and experienced. In what contexts does bodily, neurological or cognitive difference become a problem to be solved, managed, or eradicated? How do local ideas about personhood and the good life shape the way people in different societies understand disability, impairment, and debility? What does the lived experience of disability reveal about the human condition? The study of disability from an anthropological perspective is never merely a study of a medically defined deficit. It leads instead to questions about how politics, economics, policies, social practices, moral values and the potential for human flourishing and community are co-constituted. Like other categories of difference, disability provides an occasion for questioning the normative and the hegemonic. Unlike other categories of difference, disability is a form of otherness anyone could enter into at any time."
"This course will introduce students to the study of Chinese communities outside China. Ethnic Chinese communities worldwide may be considered as comprising an ethnological field. Due to the sharing of aspects of Chinese civilization, Chinese everywhere share some cultural similarities. However, the need to adapt to different ecological, political and socio-cultural environments calls for adaptation and transformation. Thus the diverse Chinese communities worldwide are ideal for comparative studies, especially on a number of anthropological/ sociological themes such as cultural continuity and transformation, cultural identities and ethnic identities, ethnic relations, social organization, and so on."
"This course will enable students to extend their anthropological learning in the classroom to an ethnographic field site. The course combines a set of standard in-class lectures and tutorials with an 8-12 day field study trip to a location typically outside Hong Kong. The field study trip will consist of both supervised student-led field research and formal face-to-face teaching including such things as guest lectures with local experts, formal professor-guided class discussions on methodology and anthropological fieldwork, guided museum tours, and local study tours focused on the cultural, political, and economic lives of local people. Students will form small groups to investigate different anthropological topics within the field site, actually “doing” anthropology!Open only to anthropology majors or minors, including minors in archaeology and in cultural heritage studies. The contents of this course will vary with different instructors and students. Offerings under the same course code, but with different field sites can be taken for credit, up to a maximum of two times."
"In this course, students will read some recent ethnographic writing about China. We will come to understand China from a wide variety of perspectives and grapple with questions of the power and limitations of social anthropology to illuminate Chinese society. The weeks will be organized according to topics, but students should remember that ethnographic writing tends to be holistic, so that the author of a given ethnography may use the “topic” of the book as a lens through which she or he explores a wide variety of issues."
"Advisory: Students are required to have taken at least one course related to gender.This course will be a cross-cultural and historical study of the contexts in which gender and sexuality are articulated and contested in law. Premised on a social constructivist understanding of gender and sexuality, the course aims to provide a set of tools for students to understand and analyze the norms and frameworks regulating human sexuality through the law. The course further locates the making of gender and sexuality in the law within histories of colonialism and imperialism. Students will learn to evaluate different legislative and judicial responses to issues directly related to sexuality such as consent, rape and adultery, prostitution and human trafficking, violence against women, homosexuality, same-sex and heterosexual marriage etc. They will also learn to examine how legal regulation of gender and sexuality extends into other areas of the law about urban space, inheritance, citizenship, immigration and asylum, as well as the prison system. The course aims at providing students with the critical tools to analyze the cultural and historical constructions that inform “laws in the books, laws in the mind, and laws in action.”"
"This course examines the nature and structure of language, and analyses language within human social worlds. It explores sociolinguistics — how linguistic behaviour is shaped by sociocultural factors — and also metaphor, and the problems of cultural interpretation and translation. It also examines a range of symbols in society, the language not just of words but of clothing, material goods, popular culture and political discourse, to understand how cultural symbols are socially constructed, performed and contested. Language and symbols and their social uses form a central topic of anthropological inquiry; this course will explore and explicate this topic."
"Landscape is a reflection of past interactions between people and their physical environment, which cumulatively create highly recognizable and culturally distinctive places. Such unique and geographically-defined records of particular groups and their way of life are what UNESCO calls “cultural landscapes” (Rössler 2006). Landscapes also reflect and embody intangible beliefs and if we are to understand such ‘non-material’ meanings we must embrace both Western and non-Western (e.g. Chinese) approaches to their study. Hong Kong’s cultural landscape is overwhelmingly urban and modern in character, embedded within, beyond and beneath the city lie other ‘hidden’ landscapes reflecting more ancient belief systems and traditional practices such as agrarian and maritime lifeways and their ‘traditional’ belief systems. Also, Hong Kong has many culturally important ‘ephemeral’ landscapes, relating to the temporary transformation of spaces, for example during religious festivals, or even the more routine transformations that occur at street eateries (dai pai dong) or markets. This course explores the concept “landscape”, its tangible and intangible dimensions, how they are physically evidenced locally and abroad, and how anthropologists, archaeologists and a myriad of other disciplines approach their study and interpretation. In particular, we will work through a series of local case studies to see what landscape can tell us about the lifeways, economies, politics and beliefs of past and present communities in Hong Kong. By studying cultural landscapes we can also identify what past and present communities, organisations and governments chose to keep and protect and what they let go – by assessing such processes we can develop an understanding of the underlying socio-political and economic drivers at work through time. In terms of heritage management, therefore, if we wish to militate against the gradual loss of meaning and value in our cultural landscapes, a landscape approach is indicated."
"Advisory: ANTH1710 is preferred and priority will be given to students who had taken ANTH1710.This course is an introduction to archaeological field methods and techniques based on lectures, discussion, and small group practicum classes. The course will start with developing relevant computing skills, the use of reference collections, and the analysis of raw data, as an integral part of the basic tool-kit of archeological field work. Topics of the course will include:• survey techniques, including augering and field walking;• excavation strategies and recording, including planning and photography;• conservation of archaeological remains or features during excavation;• sampling strategies for dating evidence and other environmental analyses;• post-excavation, report-writing, publication and archiving."
"This course will enable students to extend their archaeological learning in the classroom to an archaeological field site. The course combines a set of standard in-class lectures and tutorials with an 8-12 day field study trip to a location typically outside Hong Kong. The field study trip will consist of both supervised student-led field research and formal face-to-face teaching including such things as guest lectures with local experts, formal professor-guided class discussions on methodology and archaeological fieldwork, guided museum tours, and local study tours focused on the cultural, political, and economic lives of local people. Students will form small groups to investigate different archaeological topics within the field site, actually “doing” archaeology!Open only to anthropology majors or minors, including minors in archaeology and in cultural heritage studies. The contents of this course will vary with different instructors and students. Offerings under the same course code, but with different field sites can be taken for credit, up to a maximum of two times."
"In this course students will learn the major theories about ethnic groups and ethnicity, as well as ethnographic examples from different parts of the world, Asia in particular. Major topics include the concept of ethnic group, formation of ethnic groups, the state and indigenous peoples, ethnic relations, nationalism, and the relationship between culture, ethnicity and identities."
"This course explores the history of the moving image in anthropological inquiry. Its primary focus is on the analysis and interpretation of ethnographic films, both the classics as well as non-fiction films with ethnographic value. Students will have the opportunity to do a visual project."
"In this STOT course, students will be guided to start a 2-semester independent research project and write an undergraduate thesis. In this process, they will become familiar with the arts of anthropological fieldwork. Advisory: For final year Major students only."

"The content of this course varies from semester to semester, but concentrates either on selected problems related to the encounter with other societies through anthropological fieldwork, or on special issues in anthropological theory."
"This course will focus on the intersection between culture and biology, and introduces major cultural concepts and theories on medicine and health. Starting with an overview of the development of medical knowledge and health care, and the role of society and culture in formulating theories and myths of sickness and healing, the course will examine issues such as culture-bound syndromes and cross-cultural stress and psychiatry; ritual, religious beliefs, and medicine; anthropological perspectives on epidemiology, pharmacology, and doctor-patient relationships; Chinese and Western medical systems; and health and inequality across ethnicity, class and gender. Students are encouraged to think critically about the interaction between biological, environmental and social factors in health and illness, and, as the world becomes more globalized, the integration of alternative medical systems in culturally diverse environments, as well as global health."
"This course will introduce anthropological approaches to urban studies. Topics to be explored include theories of the origin and development of cities, urbanity in different cultures, urban life and social organization, and problems of urbanization such as adjustment of rural migrants to city life."
"This course discusses the role of the museum in contemporary society. Museums have long been regarded as the treasure house of the cultural legacy of a country and its people. Today museums are relevant to many fields such as education, science, culture, tourism and environmental protection; thus museums play important roles in contemporary societies. Topics include the definition of the museum, and analyses of the museum’s history and functions, with special emphasis on introducing how a museum is run, and the technical issues of how the artifacts and information are restored, preserved and displayed. Excursions will be made to selected museums in Hong Kong, Macau and Guangdong for observation and discussion purposes."
"The course provides an advanced review of major theoretical approaches in anthropology, from classic theories of Morgan, Tyler, Weber, and Durkheim, through the influential theories of Boas, Radcliffe-Brown, Levi-Strauss, and Geertz to more recent theories."
This course introduces the history of anthropology and the field’s various sub-disciplines. It presents key concepts and theories of the field and teaches students to understand human societies and cultures in the distinctly anthropological way.
"This course is designed for students who are interested in learning about and/or doing anthropological research -- particularly, conducting fieldwork and writing ethnography. We will do so by reading texts on anthropological research methods and ethnographers’ reflections on their fieldwork experience; and practice various techniques, which are important for conducting fieldwork and writing ethnography."
"Subject to approval by the Graduate Division, students can choose this course, and be guided by a supervisor to complete a research project. Student will learn how to conduct anthropological research on a selected topic, and write an academic paper. Readings relevant to the topic selected will be assigned. Normally students should have taken or be taking ANT5610 Anthropological Field Methods."
"In this course students will learn the major theories about ethnic groups and ethnicity, as well as ethnographic examples from different parts of the world, Asia in particular. Major topics include the concept of ethnic group, formation of ethnic groups, the state and indigenous peoples, ethnic relations, nationalism, and the relationship between culture, ethnicity and identities. MA students will read the primary literature and will be expected to write a research paper. (Not for students who have taken ANT4210.)"
"This course surveys the literature and research topics related to the socio-cultural aspects of urban and rural Hong Kong, including the farming villages in the New Territories and the fishing communities on the off-shore islands."
"This course focuses on gender in the Asian region. A comparative approach will be taken to reflect diversity and resemblance continuity and discontinuity, and historical and contemporary influences on gender within countries in the Asian region. Societies studied may vary from year to year, and may include Hong Kong, mainland China, India, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Chinese across societies. Gender issues and conditions will be examined within different contexts, covering such areas as language, class, work, family and kinship, health, sexuality, education, religion, development, and politics. Students will read the primary literature and will be expected to write a research paper."
"Students in this course will read and discuss the major ethnographies and other anthropological studies on China. Readings will provide students with general knowledge of the anthropology of China, but will vary year to year depending on the teacher."

"In societies across the world, people have different culturally-shaped senses of what their lives mean: people may live for money, love, honor, or fame; for family, company, country, or religion. This course examines the processes through which meanings of life are formulated and maintained in day-to-day life in societies past and present; it also explores life meaning as a way of comprehending the evolution of human societies. The course uses the concept of ""meanings of life"" as a window into the anthropological understanding of cultural difference and cultural evolution. Students will read intensively, and write an extensive paper exploring aspects of ""meanings of life"" as discussed by the course readings and by their own investigations."
"Death is both a human universal and a process deeply affected by the cultural context in which it occurs. Dealing with death, both practically and psychologically, is something that all humans must face. This course examines death and death ritual through the question of what is universal and what is culturally variant about how humans face death. It looks at death and death ritual in both modern and pre-modern contexts and analyses it socially, psychologically, politically, and culturally. From the course students will learn how the treatment of death varies cross-culturally; how understandings of death have shifted over human cultural evolution; what aspects of death are universal in human experience; and how death affects contemporary politics, economics, and culture."
"How can we understand the minds of other people? Do people in different cultures or societies feel and think in different ways? How do childhood experiences affect people and shape or even determine what kinds of persons they will become? What is it like to be mentally abnormal or even pathological? Do people in different cultures or societies experience, understand, and treat psychopathology in different ways? This course examines psychological experiences—feelings, perceptions, thoughts, and motivations—from social and cross-cultural perspectives. It sets out to explore the intersection between anthropology, a field that typically turns to the exotic other, and psychology, a field that often takes the universality of mental activities and mechanisms for granted. Specific focus is placed upon how ethnographers, clinicians, and researchers with training in both fields grapple with various mental phenomena and different ways of understanding them. As most of the materials are drawn from psychological anthropology, this course also serves as an eclectic introduction to this subfield, which was once influential in the history of American anthropology."

"This course is an anthropological introduction to contemporary India, its social life and diverse cultures. India is home to more than a billion people, who look differently, speak various languages, practice different religions, and have distinct rituals, cuisines, and music. It is one of the world’s powers with global economic, political, and intellectual influence. Moreover, it shares important ties in the sphere of philosophy, religion, and medicine with China and other Asian societies. Therefore, students will learn about India’s place both in the world and the Asian region, including its ties with Hong Kong. Students will also develop an understanding of the country’s diversity and complex social phenomena such as kinship, communalism, caste system, tribe, third gender, and class. We will discuss pressing issues and theoretical debates related to globalization, sexuality, social movements, religious conflicts, public health, environment, and labor, and how these issues have been shaped by post-colonial politics and current transnational processes."
"This course will focus on the intersection between culture and biology, and introduces major cultural concepts and theories on medicine and health. Starting with an overview of the development of medical knowledge and health care, and the role of society and culture in formulating theories and myths of sickness and healing, the course will examine issues such as culture-bound syndromes and cross-cultural stress and psychiatry; ritual, religious beliefs, and medicine; anthropological perspectives on epidemiology, pharmacology, and doctor-patient relationships; Chinese and Western medical systems; and health and inequality across ethnicity, class and gender. Students are encouraged to critically think about the interaction between biological, environmental and social factors in health and illness, and, as the world become more globalized, the integration of alternative medical systems in culturally diverse environments, as well as global health. MA students will read the primary literature and will be expected to write a research paper. (Not for students who have taken ANT4330.)"
"This course examines mental illness and mental health as subjective experiences, social processes, and objects of scientific knowledge and practice. It invites students to explore human experiences that are labelled as abnormal or pathological, to understand the expert knowledge and technologies employed to remedy these conditions, and to think about the complex relationships between them and the broader social and cultural contexts. Readings are drawn from psychiatric anthropology or anthropology of mental health, clinical case studies, and memoirs. They are chosen to reflect an interdisciplinary scope that includes social sciences, psychiatry itself, and the layman’s/patient’s perspective."
"This course will introduce anthropological approaches to the study of the visual and pictorial world. Classic and recent ethnographic films will be shown, and students are guided to an anthropological understanding through pictorial media. Entertainment motion pictures and documentary films will also be analysed as an anthropological issue, especially in relation to such notions as “culture”, “otherness”, and “reality”."
"This course will examine phenomena often viewed as irrational and superstitious to see how they can be understood in cultural terms. All societies have some belief in another world, yet beliefs vary widely between societies. The course will examine traditional anthropological topics such as magic, traditional healing, divination, fengshui, witchcraft, and ghosts, as well as more recent issues such as ESP, psychokinesis, qigong, vampires, zombies, monsters, UFOs and alien abduction. The role of myth in modern society and the cultural creation of reality will be highlighted. The power of a cultural approach in explaining the supernatural and the limits of what science can explain will also be discussed. Students will read the primary literature and will be expected to write a research paper."
"Religious practices and beliefs permeate most aspects of culture throughout the world and religion has always been one of the most important topics in anthropology and liberal studies. This course examines the following aspects of religion: magic & sorcery, symbolism & ritual, gender and religion, shamanism, syncretism, and social change driven by religious ideas. The course also introduces major traditions of social theory: each tradition offers a different way of looking at the role of religion in people's lives. This course thus introduces students to various forms of religious expression around the world and also exposes them to different interpretations of religion. MA students will read the primary literature and will be expected to write a research paper."
"This course explores the relations between the body, love, and emotions from an anthropological perspective. People acquire a special sense of presence, knowledge, and power from the brute fact of their bodies as sentient, sensuous, instinctual, habitual, feeling, and erotic organisms. At the same time, this special presence has made the materiality of the body a contested site for representational practices and politics in which love and emotions have figured centrally. Through an ethnographic focus on cross-cultural studies of love and emotions, this course seeks to juxtapose and reconcile the body's manifold facets as materiality and representation, subject and object. We will address the following questions: What are the culturally differentiating politics and poetics of the seemingly universal emotion of love? What conceptions of the body and personhood do they articulate? How do modern notions of love and desire underscore changing gender relations, sexual identities, and embodied ideals of masculinity and femininity? How do affect and embodiment intersect with the problems of class, race, ethnicity, and nationality?MA students will read the primary literature and will be expected to write a research paper."
"This course will focus on the social implications and cultural meanings of food. Topics to be covered include: ecology, food and foodways, diffusion of food; cultural uses of food; table manners; social relations, gender and the construction of identities through food; commensality and social relations; food taboos and food symbolism; globalization and localization of fast food; the continuity and discontinuity of traditions; concepts of fitness, beauty and medical beliefs in the production and consumption of food; and food security. We will explore the role of the state, popular culture, and individual agency in the change in foodways."
"This course will study tourism from an anthropological perspective. The study of tourism enables us to examine such issues as globalization and transnationalism, travel and borderzones, the invention and representation of culture, the marketing of tradition, the commoditizing of culture, museums and heritage, authenticity and identity formation, and the quest of the industrialized nations for the folk, the exotic, and the past."
"This course offers students a chance to explore the various sub-disciplines of anthropology. Students read for one topic each week, and discuss readings in a seminar with a teacher. The readings and discussions help prepare students for the General Anthropology Examination."
"This course introduces students to the study of ethics and morality from a social and cross-cultural perspective. Ethics and morality may appear to be an abstract subject for philosophers, but this course shall demonstrate how they are in fact a close part of our everyday lives. Human beings living in different societies have different ideas about what constitutes the good and the right. How and why do they differ? Does the cross-cultural study of morality and ethics lead to moral relativism? What are some shared human problems? How do people manage to get along with each other, and how does a person learn to get along with oneself? “Ethics and the Human Experience” will prioritize context in understanding what shapes the good and the right. But ultimately, the class aims to expand our moral imagination beyond the usual concerns, and to more deeply understand the human experience."
"This course presents the political economy approach to the study of culture. It introduces the major topics of the subfi elds of economic and political anthropology, as well as the goals and dilemmas of applied anthropology. The course will examine the cultural evolution of societies, how culture shapes – and is shaped by – the production, distribution and consumption of goods, the flow and accumulation of power, and the nature of conflict and governance. The course will show how a holistic cultural approach can improve our understanding of power and the economy, and how only by considering power and material life can we fully understand culture. Students will read the primary literature and will be expected to write a research paper."
"Disability may appear to be a brute fact, a form of difference readily apparent in a person’s body or behavior. But is this necessarily the case? The study of disability from an anthropological perspective is in fact a study of difference, that is, how categories of difference are made and experienced. In what contexts does bodily, neurological or cognitive difference become a problem to be solved, managed, or eradicated? How do local ideas about personhood and the good life shape the way people in different societies understand disability, impairment, and debility? What does the lived experience of disability reveal about the human condition? The study of disability from an anthropological perspective is never merely a study of a medically defined deficit. It leads instead to questions about how politics, economics, policies, social practices, moral values and the potential for human flourishing and community are co-constituted. Like other categories of difference, disability provides an occasion for questioning the normative and the hegemonic. Unlike other categories of difference, disability is a form of otherness anyone could enter into at any time."
"This course examines selected topics, both area-related and problem-oriented, within the field of ethnography. Semester offerings will vary with the instructor and may include such topics as regional studies, classic and contemporary ethnographic writings, and the problem of the anthropologist and fieldwork."

"This class begins its study of Islam by examining the historical developments of Islam in pre-Islamic Arabia and looking at the life of various religious figures. It then examines aspects of Islamic civilization, culture and philosophy. Finally it addresses issues of the so-called ‘politicization of religion’ in the context of globalizing modernity and violent conflict. Throughout this course we will investigate the insights that anthropological analyses can offer to discussions centering the relations between Muslim societies and the West. Students in this course will engage in in-depth reading and discussion, and will write reports and research papers on aspects of Islam."
"This course will introduce anthropological approaches to urban studies. Topics to be explored include theories of the origin and development of cities, urbanity in different cultures, urban life and social organization, and problems of urbanization such as adjustment of rural migrants to city life. MA students will read the primary literature and will be expected to write a research paper. (Not for students who have taken ANT4410.)"
"The remarkable economic emergence of China and Asia more broadly in recent decades has transformed many impoverished and largely agriculturally based societies into the most dynamic region of the contemporary world. China’s burgeoning aspirational middle classes, rapid urbanisation, time-space compression and the shift from command economies to de-regulated markets have had profound effects on people's everyday lives and the diverse cultural practices that have long shaped local livelihoods and community expectations. This course offers an introduction into anthropological approaches to the study of culture, modernity and globalisation in China and Asia more broadly. Relevant themes that have attracted anthropological interest include changing traditions and popular culture, adaptive custom and cosmopolitanism, migration and citizenship, identity politics and social movements as well as distinctive and emergent forms of governance in both collective and self-cultivating forms of expression. Drawing on a rich corpus of social theory and ethnographic research from anthropologists past and present, the course will provide students with conceptual and analytical tools to appreciate adaptive cultural practices in comparative terms, to review and appreciate the key anthropological debates and influential works in the study of modernity, and to introduce students to ethnographic approaches for researching and writing on modernity and contemporary ethnographies of global connection."
"This course provides an anthropological approach to the study of Japan and Korea, with a particular focus on social change and their infl uences on other East Asian countries. This course will concentrate on cultural traditions, lineage, religions, social structure and contemporary international relationships of the two countries. Teaching materials will include ethnographies, popular writings, news features, movies, etc., in order to provide students with a comprehensive approach for understanding the cultures of Japan and Korea. MA students will read the primary literature and will be expected to write a research paper. (Not for students who have taken ANT4460.)"
"The primary aim of this course is to introduce peoples and cultures of Southeast Asia through the study of anthropology. The course will highlight cultural similarities and differences and explore the issues of ethnicity, development and national identity."
"This course will introduce students to the study of Chinese communities outside China. Ethnic Chinese communities worldwide may be considered as comprising an ethnological field. Due to the sharing of aspects of Chinese civilization, Chinese everywhere share some cultural similarities. However, the need to adapt to different ecological, political and sociocultural environments calls for adaptation and transformation. Thus the diverse Chinese communities worldwide are ideal for comparative studies, especially on a number of anthropological/sociological themes such as cultural continuity and transformation, cultural identities and ethnic identities, ethnic relations, social organization, and so on. Students will read the primary literature and will be expected to write a research paper."
"This course will enable students to extend their anthropological learning in the classroom to an ethnographic field site. The course combines a set of standard in-class lectures and tutorials with an 8-12 day field study trip to a location typically outside Hong Kong. The field study trip will consist of both supervised student-led field research and formal face-to-face teaching including such things as guest lectures with local experts, formal professor-guided class discussions on methodology and anthropological fieldwork, guided museum tours, and local study tours focused on the cultural, political, and economic lives of local people. Students will form small groups to investigate different anthropological topics within the field site.Open only to anthropology majors.The contents of this course will vary with different instructors and students. Offerings under the same course code, but with different field sites can be taken for credit, up to a maximum of two times."
"This course will examine the role of culture in contemporary business. It will introduce anthropological approaches to the study of work and management in industrial societies. Topics include cross-cultural communication in business settings, business organization (e.g., the Japanese factory, the Chinese family firm), cultural values and the motivation to work, retail marketing and consumer culture, and occupational and company sub-culture."
"Globalization is economically transforming the world, as national borders become increasingly irrelevant before the global flow of money and goods. But globalization also has a great impact on cultures across the globe, as products from Coca-Cola to iPods, and ideas from human rights to ideals of beauty to ideologies of terrorism, intrude everywhere. This course examines how globalization is fundamentally transforming the meanings of culture. The course objectives are to enable students 1) to have greater insight into the processes of “the globalization of culture,” and 2) to better understand the nature of their own culture and selves within a globalizing world. (Not for students who have taken ANT5560.)"
"This course examines the problem of violence and its political uses from an anthropological and comparative perspective. The range of phenomena that can be called violent is very broad. We focus here on the state and human rights and the ways various state and non-state actors promote their political goals through violent means. We will also examine the cultural issues involving human rights (such as human rights as a universal value and the issue of cultural relativism) and analyze the discourses and practices of human rights as politics, and what these new forms of political authority may entail. MA students will read the primary literature and will be expected to write a research paper."
"This course will be a cross-cultural and historical study of the contexts in which gender and sexuality are articulated and contested in law. Premised on a social constructivist understanding of gender and sexuality, the course aims to provide a set of tools for students to understand and analyze the norms and frameworks regulating human sexuality through the law. The course further locates the making of gender and sexuality in the law within histories of colonialism and imperialism. Students will learn to evaluate different legislative and judicial responses to issues directly related to sexuality such as consent, rape and adultery, prostitution and human trafficking, violence against women, homosexuality, same-sex and heterosexual marriage etc. They will also learn to examine how legal regulation of gender and sexuality extends into other areas of the law about urban space, inheritance, citizenship, immigration and asylum, as well as the prison system. The course aims at providing students with the critical tools to analyze the cultural and historical constructions that inform “laws in the books, laws in the mind, and laws in action.”"
"Focusing on working cultures, this course offers an anthropological perspective to understand how work is a matter of place, time, power, and meanings; how current social, technological, and cultural transformations of work can be understood across places, in their historic continuities and disruptions. Each week the course is structured to explore, discuss, and rethink a key concept in the anthropology of work: Class, time, race, gender, value, craft, ownership, creativity, autonomy, discipline, etc. By learning through contemporary ethnographies of different places and circumstances, students will gain the tools to connect observation, analysis, writing and theory to explore work in familiar or unexpected forms, as well as in different organizational settings from the office, into the home and onto social media platforms."
"This course examines the nature and structure of language, and analyses language within human social worlds. It explores sociolinguistics -how linguistic behaviour is shaped by socio-cultural factors - and also metaphor and the problems of cultural interpretation and translation. It also examines a range of symbols in society, the language not just of words but of clothing, material goods, popular culture and political discourse, to understand how cultural symbols are socially constructed, performed and contested. Language and symbols and their social use form a central topic of anthropological inquiry; this course explores and explicate this topic. Students engage in intensive readings, and write extended essays tying the content of the course to their own interests in language."
"This course explores the history of the moving image in anthropological inquiry. Its primary focus is on the analysis and interpretation of ethnographic films, both the classics as well as non-fiction films with ethnographic value. Students will have the opportunity to do a visual project. MA students will read the primary literature and will be expected to write a research paper. (Not for students who have taken ANT4220.)"
"This course looks at the relationship between gender and culture, by comparing women in societies with different modes of production and social organization. Through analysing their sex roles, enculturation process, kinship, division of labour by sex, power and control, and social development, students will understand how culture infl uences the concept of gender and its related behaviour among human groups."
"This course will discuss the history and development of Chinese archaeology, the subjects, research methods and theories of archaeology in mainland China, the formation of the Paleolithic and Neolithic cultures in China, and significant archaeological discoveries of the Bronze Age and historical periods. It will examine how archaeology is related to the construction of Chinese identity and nationalism, and related academic debates. It will also re-evaluate ancient Chinese civilization from the perspectives of ancient Asia and the world. Students will read the primary literature and will be expected to write a research paper."

"This course will review major archaeological discoveries in Hong Kong, trace the arrival of the earliest Hong Kong inhabitants at around 6000 years ago, examine the succeeding cultural development, and discuss the material culture, social structures and beliefs of ancient Hong Kong. Cultural similarities and differences between ancient Hong Kong, South China and Southeast Asia will also be compared, and the significance of Hong Kong archaeology in the contexts of South China and Southeast Asia will be evaluated. The course will also address the management of archaeological remains in contemporary Hong Kong, and discuss the political and economic issues. Students will read the primary literature and will be expected to write a research paper."
"This course aims to give students the basic knowledge and training on cultural heritage preservation, including archaelogical excavation, report and analysis, and the preservation of ancient architectures and monuments. The course includes the following topics: 1) concepts and international conventions/policies of cultural heritage preservation; 2) archaeological excavation: methods, procedures and standards; 3) archaelogical recording and analysing; and 4) preservation of ancient architectures and monuments: standards and procedures. Students are required to participate in fieldwork and to write a research paper based upon course reading and fieldwork."
"How we understand the past defines the way how we understand our current situation. Archaeology is a dynamic discipline that has tremendously expanded our knowledge about the past, but this subject is not just about digging and doing fieldwork. A wide range of new techniques (e.g., metallurgy, zoology, and 3d stimulation) and research methods have been incorporated into current archaeological research, and eventually transformed the understanding of ourselves and our culture in many ways. This course provides a general introduction in terms of two specific domains: 1) basic archaeological science that changed the research paradigm of human culture and history; 2) an overall history about ancient technology illustrated by new research techniques to explain how this modern world took shape. Moreover, this course tries to cultivate students’ cross-disciplinary research skills and prepare them for the arrival of a new, digitalized research era."
"This course aims to give students a visual and integrated understanding of Chinese civilization and cultural development in mainland China through analyzing China’s material cultural heritage, mainly traditional villages, ancient cities and grottos, as well as ceramics, jade and bronze items. The course will discuss the ecological, economic and cultural meanings of the above cultural properties in China, examine the preservation, management and exploitation of cultural heritage and analyze how China’s heritage has been re-interpreted and reconstructed to suit current economic, social and political needs, including the development of tourism, and the construction of ethnicity, nationalism and Chinese identity. Students will be required to do extra reading materials and discussion with the teacher."
"Landscape is a reflection of past interactions between people and their physical environment, which cumulatively create highly recognizable and culturally distinctive places. Such unique and geographically-defined records of particular groups and their way of life are what UNESCO calls “cultural landscapes” (Rössler 2006). Landscapes also reflect and embody intangible beliefs and if we are to understand such ‘non-material’ meanings we must embrace both Western and non-Western (e.g. Chinese) approaches to their study. Hong Kong’s cultural landscape is overwhelmingly urban and modern in character, embedded within, beyond and beneath the city lie other ‘hidden’ landscapes reflecting more ancient belief systems and traditional practices such as agrarian and maritime lifeways and their ‘traditional’ belief systems. Also, Hong Kong has many culturally important ‘ephemeral’ landscapes, relating to the temporary transformation of spaces, for example during religious festivals, or even the more routine transformations that occur at street eateries (dai pai dong) or markets. This course explores the concept “landscape”, its tangible and intangible dimensions, how they are physically evidenced locally and abroad, and how anthropologists, archaeologists and a myriad of other disciplines approach their study and interpretation. In particular, we will work through a series of local case studies to see what landscape can tell us about the lifeways, economies, politics and beliefs of past and present communities in Hong Kong. By studying cultural landscapes we can also identify what past and present communities, organisations and governments chose to keep and protect and what they let go – by assessing such processes we can develop an understanding of the underlying socio-political and economic drivers at work through time. In terms of heritage management, therefore, if we wish to militate against the gradual loss of meaning and value in our cultural landscapes, a landscape approach is indicated."
"This course will enable students to extend their archaeological learning in the classroom to an archaeological field site. The course combines a set of standard in-class lectures and tutorials with an 8-12 day field study trip to a location typically outside Hong Kong. The field study trip will consist of both supervised student-led field research and formal face-to-face teaching including such things as guest lectures with local experts, formal professor-guided class discussions on methodology and archaeological fieldwork, guided museum tours, and local study tours focused on the cultural, political, and economic lives of local people. Students will form small groups to investigate different archaeological topics within the field site.Open only to anthropology majors.The contents of this course will vary with different instructors and students. Offerings under the same course code, but with different field sites can be taken for credit, up to a maximum of two times."
"What does it mean to be human? Where did we come from? Where are we going? This courses investigates long-term evolutionary perspectives on the human species. The basics of evolution and natural selection as scientific theories are clearly set out and examined, and common misconceptions discussed. Evidence for the evolution of mammals and primates is reviewed and discussed, and the common characteristics of these species are highlighted, demonstrating the connections between humans and other forms of life. The course covers what we know about human ancestors and the evolution of modern humans. Students are introduced to the wide range of human adaptations to local conditions across contemporary cultures and the variety of relationships that human populations have with the environment. Students are encouraged to use the knowledge they have acquired to ask; are these relationships always sustainable? Looking to the future; what are our responsibilities both to future generations of humans and towards other species with which we share our world? This course aims to give students an understanding and appreciation of evolutionary perspectives on the place of humans in the world, the variety of contemporary human societies, and a broad perspective on the complexity of the relationship between humans, the environment and other species."
"Interest in the field of forensic anthropology has been heightened in the last decade through the success of forensic-themed television shows and popular novels. This course will introduce students to the field of forensic anthropology – a scientific discipline that involves the application of methods from biological anthropology and archaeology to the identification, recovery, and analysis of skeletal remains from crime scenes, mass disasters, and unexplained death. Through lectures and in-class assignments, students will learn about the methods for recognizing and recovering evidence that allows for the determination of time since death, manner and cause of death, and the identification of individuals."
"The course is designed to give M.Phil and Ph.D. students a solid foundation for understanding sociocultural anthropological theory. It provides an advanced review of major theoretical approaches, from classic theories of Marx, Weber, and Durkheim, through twentieth-century theories of Boas, Radcliffe-Brown, Levi-Strauss, and Geertz, to contemporary theories such as those of Bourdieu, Foucault, Ortner, and Appadurai."
"The course aims to train and develop students’ ability to do anthropological research. Course contents consist of class lectures and independent research projects, and focus on field methods, data analysis and presentation, and thesis writing."
