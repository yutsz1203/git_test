"(UGEA1212 is double-coded with GRMD1003.)  This course aims to introduce China’s cultural heritages from the perspective of cultural geography. As an important sub-discipline in human geography, cultural geography examines how people use space and develop it into places – a process of cultural landscape formation. “Space” here is nothing immutable or monolithic; instead, individuals, groups, civilizations and their culture “craft” characteristic places through interactions with the surrounding environment and specific political and economic systems (themselves determined by culture). China provides numerous extraordinary examples to illustrate these topics. The course includes four key components: 1) the theoretical foundation: fundamentals of cultural geography; 2) the legacies and regional variations of China’s cultural heritages; 3) topical issues about China’s cultural heritages; 4) the cultural convergence in aspects of globalization and cultural transformation. The course provides not only a body of knowledge about the cultural landscape and spatial variations of places in China, but also an understanding of their major transformations that have taken place in a globalizing world."

Emphasis will be placed on the nexus between economic globalization and local development as well as regional disparity in our global village."
"This course looks at the interplay between the natural and human aspects of the world’s regions. Planet Earth is a complex system with diverse climatic zones, landforms, geology, soils, vegetation and habitats; the processes and forces leading to their evolution and formation are different in both spatial and temporal scales. The course examines these complexities of nature and discusses the ways in which different societies have dealt with it. Over the history of human civilizations, different societies have taken very different approaches towards nature. This is reflected in different aspects of social institutions (political, economic, social, cultural, religious, etc.) that human beings have created to organize themselves."
"This course introduces a geographical approach to the study of global environmental change and its threats to environmental sustainability.

"Understanding uneven global development is an important agenda in geography and politics alike. In an era of globalization, the regional and national aspects of growth are continuously contested through both spatial (e.g. areas, their interactions and relationship with other areas) and aspatial (e.g. institutional and political factors) processes. This course will provide an overview of key economic-geographical theories and concepts in analyzing economic processes at various geographical scales. To this end, the relationships between space, economy and society will be discussed using a number of cases. Topics cover globalization and local development, and how they work together to shape spatial organization and economic change, location of production and transnational corporations, and spatial interaction and network. The course provides an excellent vehicle toward understanding today’s increasingly interdependent world."
"(UGEC2171 is double-coded with GRMD2401.)  Sustainable development is a global vision for the future. This approach to development should not only generate economic growth, but also distribute its benefits equitably, regenerate the environment rather than destroy it, as well as empower people rather than marginalize them. The UN 2030 Agenda came into effect in 2015 promising to “interlink and integrate” Sustainable Development Goals in an attempt to implement solutions facing humanity. Sustainable development goals are an all-inclusive invitation to act to end poverty, secure the planet and ensure that all people appreciate peace and prosperity.This course introduces the concept of sustainable development, the evolution of models and the implicit assumptions they make, as well as their contradictions. It also traces the advent of the SDGs and the extent that they support the principles of sustainable development. We examine the emergence of environmental problems and critically review the institutional responses to these problems since the late 1960s. We then consider in detail the increasingly popular idea of efforts in the pursuit of the SDGs from different perspectives that centres around people, planet, prosperity, peace and the partnerships involved in achieving the goals. The lectures will explore how achieving sustainable development goals will depends much on effective planning and good governance. Examples from different parts of the world will be used to underline the tight inter-connections between processes in different regions and across geographical scales in the context of sustainable development."
"Given that humankind worldwide depends on natural resources for survival, the course will provide an overview of the principles of natural resource management. The course will specifically be useful to students interested in understanding the issues associated with use and misuse of natural resources. Lectures, field trips, seminars and study assignments will be used to focus attention and help analyze natural resources according to biotic resources, physical and earth resources and the social sciences, by identifying principles and practices used to organize natural resources for human use. Understanding these principles will allow for environmentally sound management of natural resources. The understanding of the physical and earth resources will facilitate the prudent management of resources such as land, water, waste. Applying social sciences systems of inquiry will prepare students for understanding the management, administration and policy issues that could affect humanities use of natural resources, globally, regionally and locally."
"(UGEB2113 is double-coded with GRMD2403.)  This course aims at providing students with an overall view on nature conservation in general and Hong Kong in particular. The concepts and principles of nature conservation will be addressed from a holistic point of view, followed by an investigation of nature conservation practices and their effect on the environment in Hong Kong. The latter shall include legislation, designation and management of the protected areas. Specifically, country, marine parks and geopark are developed to protected terrestrial and marine habitats as well as the associated wildlife, and geodiversity, respectively. Threats to protected areas and their mitigation for sustainability in Hong Kong will also be addressed alongside comparison with overseas experiences. The course does not teach students how to identify the different species of plants, birds, insects, corals or rocks. Instead, it provides a framework for students to look at nature conservation from the perspective of sustainable development, that is incorporating the economic, social, environmental and institutional dimensions of development. The new initiatives of nature conservation in the 21st century in response to globalization and climate change will be addressed towards the end of the course."
"The historical evolution of the human society is significantly affected by how we consume energy. Our modern society is built on modern energy consumption patterns. However, rising energy consumption also raises serious environmental challenges that are detrimental to human beings and our planet Earth. Accordingly, one critical goal of energy development is to maximize the positive impacts and to minimize the negative impacts of energy consumption. After discussing the role of energy consumption in a society, this course will analyze how energy consumption and the environment affect each other. Students will then be guided through various levels of a society, from individuals, households, communities, to cities, countries and the world in general discussion and case studies on how energy is consumed. Recognizing the importance of energy conservation as a key solution, this course will further examine two major barriers, particularly the behavior and efficiency gaps, to understand how we could achieve the goal. An open and especially active mind is a must for success in this course."
"Smart cities have been practiced in many world cities in the last decade. The advancement of technology and innovation has enabled cities to become smarter.

"Map is an important tool to communicate spatial information based on which rational decisions can be made. Many geographic information system (GIS) related assignments are to produce maps, i.e. to present spatial data, process, and analytical results in form of map products. Cartographic knowledge and technique is a type of grammar that allows for the effective design and production of quality maps and other visual products. However, in recent decades, the process of map production is changing from supply to demand-driven and the function of maps emphasizes more on exploratory capability. Cartographers follow stipulated methods and techniques while incorporation of new ideas due to the emergent paradigm shift becomes equally important in map production. By adopting the five-step design thinking process, meaningful and innovative ideas can be generated in creating better maps for visual communication and exploration.This course introduces the principles of cartography and design thinking process. Fundamental concepts of cartography include map projection and conventional map design theories such as colour theory, symbolization and map design will be covered in the first part of the course. The design thinking process including empathize, define, ideate, prototype and test is introduced and practiced associated with a map-making problem that is going to be solved by students in group. This course is taught with lectures, laboratories and interactive class activities. Lectures are designed to cover important theoretical concepts while the laboratories are implemented to provide students hands-on experience and skills on cartographic presentation and visualization using several software tools. Design thinking ideology is penetrated through the process of map production."

"Our modern society is built on modern energy consumption. However, rising energy consumption also raises serious environmental challenges that are detrimental to human beings and our planet Earth. On one hand, energy is a key foundation of our modern way of life. Electricity illuminates and operates the world. Modern transportation systems are energy intensive. The consumption of natural gas for cooking avoids indoor air pollution that is causing over one million premature deaths in poor countries. On the other hand, energy also creates many problems, such as air pollution, excessive water consumption and pollution, and most importantly, global climate change. Energy plays a crucial role in shaping the current global financial system through the petrodollar system, but also has frequently casted shadows on geopolitical and sometimes military conflicts. With a great majority of global CO2 emissions under national/regional carbon neutrality (or net zero) commitments, our utilization of energy resources will go through fundamental reforms.

Field trips will be conducted to enhance the students’ learning experience and technical skills in an outdoor setting."
"The course introduces and examines the theories, processes and methodologies of environmental planning and assessment as important tools and instruments for minimizing human impacts on the environment and achieving environmental sustainability through good governance. Environmental planning plays a vital role in urban design and the formulation of land use and other planning strategies in order to mitigate the effects of human activities on air, water, land, and ecological systems, and to promote sustainable use of energy, water and other natural resources. While the coverage is broad and comprehensive, emphasis will be placed on the two most prominent tools, i.e. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), in terms of their origins, legal and regulatory requirements, and practices around the world. After introducing the conceptual framework and theoretical foundation of environmental assessment, specific methods and techniques (both qualitative and quantitative) will be introduced for students to understand the procedures and systems and gain the technical skills for practical applications. Environmental planning considerations and impact assessment will be examined for different sectors (industry, commercial, transportation, etc.) and multiple environmental media (air, water, solid waste, and noise) at difference spatial scales (local, regional, and national). Although a global perspective and comparative approach will be adopted throughout the course, examples and case studies of mitigating and managing environmental impacts through planning and assessment will mainly come from Hong Kong and mainland China."
