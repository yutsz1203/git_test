"This course introduces computer programming to students with no previous programming experience. Students learn the fundamentals of python programming and learn how to design, implement, test, debug, and document programs. They also learn how to solve problems using object-oriented programming methodology. Most of the examples and assignments will be related to biological questions in genomics and bioinformatics."
"This course introduces students to the molecular mechanisms responsible for the transmission, expression and regulation of genetic information in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Students will also learn the basic concepts of genetics including population genetics, developmental genetics and evolutionary genetics."
"This course covers several computational technologies in bioinformatics. First, students learn the fundamentals of Linux OS and shell and learn how to accustom themselves to the Linux computing environment for routine bioinformatics tasks. Students also learn how to run and install common bioinformatics tools from the command line. In the second half of this course, students learn the basic statistical methods for bioinformatics, and how to use R to conduct statistical tests and create graphs for bioinformatics questions. Hands-on practice is provided throughout the whole course, whereas a comprehensive genomics project enhances students’ learning on the technologies above mentioned."
"This course introduces the basic concepts of genomics. It covers the structure and organization of human genome, and the strategies that are used to map, sequence and analyze the genomes. Students learn how to make connections between genomic data and the relevant biological questions. They also learn how genomic sequence information is utilized biomedicine including pharmacogenomics, drug discovery, diagnostics and personalized medicine."
"This course introduces the basic concepts underlying the theoretical basis of common bioinformatics algorithms. It covers the topics of sequence alignment, phylogeny, motifs finding, assembly, metagenomics and machine learning. Students learn these topics by attending lectures, classroom activities, and getting hands-on experience through assignments."
"This course introduces how systems biology combines molecular biology and genomics with physical chemistry and mathematical modeling to analyze and model biological systems. Students will learn a broad range of modeling methods relevant to systems and computational biology and apply them in several practical biological networks such as transcriptional regulatory networks, cell signaling networks, and metabolic networks."
"This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of genome informatics. Students will gain knowledge about various aspects of genomics studies, including reference genome studies, population genomic studies, and applications of genomics. The course covers both the fundamental concepts and the latest advancements in each of these categories. In addition to theoretical lectures, students will have the opportunity to engage in hands-on practice using relevant tools. This practical experience will enhance their understanding of genomics and bioinformatics, allowing them to apply their knowledge effectively."
"Students are required to conduct a research project on a current topic in genomics and bioinformatics under the research supervisors at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. This course gives students an insight into how research is carried out in the fields of bioinformatics, with selected research techniques and data analysis approaches. It will give students the opportunity to develop and enhance their analytical and organizational skills through hands-on research and the opportunity to develop their ability to work independently. This course also provides practice in writing project reports and presenting scientific findings."
