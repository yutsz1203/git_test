"This course presents an introduction to clouds. We begin with a descriptive cloud classification to introduce the different types of clouds in the Earth’s atmosphere. This is followed by cloud microphysics, describing some of the basic microphysical processes regarding formation, growth, shrinkage, breakup and fallout of cloud and precipitation particles. This will then be linked to cloud dynamics, associated with the fluid motions of the atmosphere. Next, different structures of precipitation and radar cloud sensing shall be presented. These shall then feedback onto our beginning description of clouds on the global climatological level. Student taking this course are expected to have taken EESC2020 or ESSC2020."

"Remote sensing observations are critical for monitoring regional and global changes, determining spatial and temporal variability of the Earth System, and addressing fundamental global issues. This course introduces the basic physical principles of remote sensing, including electromagnetic waves and radiation, optical, microwave, and non-imaging remote sensing. It also presents key concepts and examples on remote sensing applications in Earth system science (such as atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere) and global changes. This course also provides computer-based lab exercises that facilitate the understanding of remote sensing principles and the processing of remote sensing data."
"This course introduces the basic principles of atmospheric modeling and provides hands-on practice to perform numerical simulations on University computing cluster. It begins with the concept of model and reviewing of physical and chemical processes in the atmosphere. After that, this course will cover introduction and hands-on practice of the three basic processes in atmospheric simulation: pre-processing data, modeling, and post-processing data. The pre-processing process refers to the preparation of data from various sources by different techniques such as the generation of emission inventories for atmospheric chemistry modeling. It then introduces numerical modeling basics such as “model equations and numerical approaches”. For post-processing, this course offers different skills in visualization of the model output and evaluation of model output against real-world observations. This course also introduces advanced knowledge in “model coupling” and “inverse modeling”. Finally, this course provides hands-on practice on simple model development experiments. During the course, we will cover basic Linux environment commands to perform the main tasks mentioned above. Overall, students can anticipate grasping basic modeling concepts and skills from this course, which are of great value to their future careers in both academia and industry."
