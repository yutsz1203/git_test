"Graham Ward, Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Oxford, once remarked, ""theology’s business has always been the transgression of boundaries. It is a discourse which requires other discourses for its very possibility."" In this light, theological study is inherently interdisciplinary. Also, theologians are increasingly getting involved in praxis, which calls for them to have the expertise to critically examine the social, cultural, and political dimensions of everyday life. This course addresses these two aspects of theological study and focuses on the various ways theology can engage with contemporary critical theories in order to theologically analyze a society along the three media of speech, money, and power, as described by Jürgen Habermas. The course selectively covers the following contemporary critical theories and topics: the Frankfurt School and Dialectical Thinking in the Marxist traditions; Michel Foucault's Theories of Power, Knowledge, Truth, Subjectivity, and Ethics; Postcolonialism and Decoloniality; Critical Theories of Everyday Resistance; Critical Historiography; Critical Theory; Feminism and Queer Theory. In addition to a survey of the various approaches to critical theories, selected prominent critical theorists from each approach will be discussed. The theological implications of these theories will be examined through the lens of selected social issues and phenomena. Students will be required to conduct a theologically critical analysis of selected issues in their home society by adopting one of the critical perspectives. This course weaves together analytical approaches from the two disciplines to provide a theologically critical understanding of contemporary social issues."
"“Experience” and reflection on it have always been a concern for theologians, despite the diversity of theological traditions that prioritize various aspects of the formative factors for theology in different ways. In addition, contemporary theologians and church leaders share a growing concern for praxis that transforms the world and the church. All of this necessitates that theologians comprehend experience not only on a philosophical and conceptual level, but also as inherently concrete and social. Consequently, theologians are becoming increasingly interested in distinctive categories of empirical data pertinent to theology and in distinctive research methodologies pertinent to the analysis of these data. This is especially true of practical theologians and empirical theologians, though it is not exclusive to them. In this light, as stated by the editors of the Eerdmans series of Studies in Ecclesiology and Ethnography, if theology is to have impact on the church and world today, theologians must learn to utilize empirical research tools to provide more accurate, disciplined, and contextually-grounded research.This course thus exposes students to a variety of empirical research methods and data analytic tools that will help them understand, evaluate, and conduct empirical research relevant to theological studies. The primary emphasis will be on qualitative approaches, but students will also learn how to read quantitative research reports critically. It aims to provide students with a foundation for integrating theological inquiry and empirical research in a manner that not only maintains the integrity of both disciplines but also employs social scientific methods in a manner that is ""theological all the way through,"" as Helen Cameron has stated. Students will be required to conduct a mini-study on selected issues in their home society/church by adopting one of the empirical research methods."
"The course studies the present landscape of unity and differences among Christians, in particular cross-denominational movements like ecumenism, evangelicalism, and the Pentecostal-charismatic movement. The course analyzes these movements and related ones like independentism, fundamentalism, and others, and considers how these different movements interact with social contexts, in what sense these movements have an ecumenical dimension, and how far they can be understood as genuine forms of contextualized Christian faith."
"The goal of the course is to explore what kind of issues churches are facing in contemporary world, to reflect and to recommend how churches respond to these challenges. The goal is not about the concern of survival, but about the concern of mission, Missio Dei. Apart from a lot of issues surrounding us, different agendas of churches (or denominations) make the selection of the issues for discussion more difficult. Due to this, the design of the course adopts an interactive approach, that is to say, we come to discuss, decide and analyze the issues for study. We work in a group, not individual, although assessment is individually based. At the same time, methodologies of theological reflection are introduced."
"In the context of Christianity as a worldwide movement, the majority of church members are women. Since the early 1800s, women have led in cross-cultural ministries of service, witness, evangelism, and philanthropic works. In order to understand these phenomena, this course will explore the context, nature, theory, and issues relating to women in world missions with particular focus on the 19th century to the present. In addition to examining important global issues for women in missions, it will cover women encounter with local culture through which to explore any selective appropriation of Western Christianity from intercultural perspective."

The theologies of the literature, which represented different stages of the development of different sects or schools and contributed to the development of Early Christianity, will be studied."
"This course continues from the basics of Biblical Hebrew I and II. It introduces the technical skills and steps involved in the exegesis of the Hebrew Bible. Therefore, the student will be taught the foundation of exegesis, how to use and read BHS (Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia) and BHQ (Biblia Hebraica Quinta), including textual criticism. The student will also learn to do lexical studies, analyze syntax with the appropriate tools. Students will learn to apply these skills on a few texts of different genres: poetry: Ps 23; instruction: Prov 2; and others. Through these primary skills, the student will be guided how to exegete the texts and also explore possibilities of interpretations."
This course aims at enabling students who have learned New Testament Greek I & II to do translation and thence exegesis of the Greek text independently.
"Most parts of the Hebrew Bible is written in narrative form. In recent years, the literary approaches to the narrative in the Hebrew Bible are proliferating. The aim of this course is to explore the artistic and literary features of the narrative in Hebrew Bible. Students will learn how to appreciate the so-called poetics of the narrative in different parts of the Hebrew Bible, including the Pentateuch, the Former Prophets and the short stories of Jonah and Ruth, and acquire skills to analyze these narratives from a literary perspective. Furthermore, students will reflect on how the literary nature of the narrative in Hebrew Bible influences our view on Bible as History and Scripture."
"This course covers the major scholarship pertaining to the so-called Deuteronomistic History (DH), a perceived coherent literary unit that encompasses the books of Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings. It provides an overview of the major models on the literary production of the DH as put forth by the historical-critical scholars throughout the 19th to 21st century and examines the literary structure, central themes, and textual issues of these books by positing them within the literary culture of the ancient times. It traces the development of the current debates on the DH that both challenge various suppositions in the original formulation of the theory and yet continue to assert the validity of the overall thesis."
"This course adopts an innovative approach to examine the interactions between Christianity and Chinese literature from the 19th to early 20th centuries. Literary texts to be analyzed include mainly the late Qing missionary novels, and works of May Fourth writers (such as Lu Xun, Bing Xin and Xu Dishan). This course aims to widen the students' perspectives in the indigenization of Christianity in Chinese religious and literary contexts, the rhetorical influences of the Bible on the emergence of modern Chinese literature, and the interdisciplinary study of literature and religion."

"This course examines the development of Christianity in Chinese Diaspora. Emphasis would be laid on the cases in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macao, Southeast Asia and North America. Students shall examine and reflect on the trends of globalization and localization by comparing the experiences in various contexts."
"Since God in Christian understanding is self-revealed, the knowledge of God is not just about a language game. Through and in Jesus Christ, we come to know God as Trinity and Creator in terms of alpha and omega. This course attempts to provide a biblical, historical, theological, philosophical and contextual analysis of the doctrine of God."
"Christ, Church and Spirit are intimately correlated in the Christian faith. This course attempts to provide a biblical, historical, theological, contextual and practical analysis of these three doctrines and their relation."
"The absence of women’s experiences and voices often seems the result and perpetuation of a blindness to gender inequality within the Church. To change this reality, we must return to a basic question: What does Christian theology reveal to the Church about the nature and place of women? The course aims at exposing students to a broad perspective and discussion about the dynamic relationship between theology and feminism. In addition to introducing the experiences of contemporary women and feminist critiques on violence, family, sexuality, poverty, ecology and media, the students will be encouraged to reexamine the ways in which the Western Judeo-Christian religious tradition has profoundly influenced our understanding of God and gender and to study the feminist interpretations of God-talks, sin and redemption, spirituality, leadership and church."
"This course will examine the impact of contemporary hermeneutical theories on the doing of theology. A survey of the development from classical to modern and contemporary hermeneutics will be given.

It will investigate the structure and content of each theological system as well as the method used in constructing it. Special attention will be paid to the interdependence of method and system. While the course focuses on modern and contemporary theology, it will briefly survey a few classical examples of systematic theology, such as the works of John of Damascus, Thomas Aquinas, and John Calvin."
"Both political and liberation theologies attempt to provide a theological reflection of the interaction between the Christian faith and the socio-political order, with reference to their particular context. They keep an active and critical dialogue with contemporary social theories. Issues like church-state relation, Christianity and human rights, Christianity and economic justice are their concern. The course not only introduces the historical development and the theological significance of political and liberation theologies, but also explores to construct a political and liberation theology that is relevant to the contemporary context."
"This course is an in-depth study of the theological perspectives of several Christian thinkers in modern and contemporary China. Case studies include T.C. Chao, Watchman Nee, Y.T Wu, Wang Mingdao, K. H.

Their contributions on Christianity indigenization and contextualization shall also be discussed."
"This course considers the various religious and theological dimensions of contemporary cinema, and examines a range of approaches to such endeavours. Since the inception of motion picture in 1895, cinema and institutional religions (including Christianity) have always been interested in each other – numerous films have used religious themes and motifs as subject matters, while religious communities have been eager to harness the cinema by critiquing, censoring, or making use of films in their ministries. The study of film from serious academic theological perspectives, however, was scarce until the mid 1990s. In this course, we explore a number of approaches by which the theological study of film can take place. These include, for example, the study of explicit representation of religious materials, the 'uncovering' of implicit religious motifs, the use of film as resource for theological reflection and construction. In particular, we shall consider how cinematic representations of certain important theological motifs may enrich conventional religious understanding. Films to be viewed and discussed cover a broad range from European art-house classics, popular Hollywood productions, to contemporary East Asian and Chinese language films."
"This course will familiarize students with the recent discourse of congregational studies flourished both in the US and the UK context.

Students will also be equipped with some tools for analyzing the local congregations."
"God’s mission (Missio Dei) is the fundamental of mission, and should be understood in context. The history of the Christian mission reveals that its mission is like an ‘Empire’ as well as a servant of the gospel. Apart from a critical review of the theology and practice of Christian mission, the course is to analyze the characteristics of glocalization and its implications for the understanding and practice of Christian mission."
"The course is designed to provide students with an in depth study of Christian Worship from Biblical, historical, liturgical, theological and contextual perspectives. After laying the foundation for liturgical and theological discussions from Biblical and historical angles, much emphasis will be placed on the development of worship forms from Vatican II to the recent ecumenical and post denominational liturgical revivals that reflect dynamic contemporary cultural and theological dialogues in the post modern era."
"This course aims at the study of hymns and the development of church music in historical perspectives. It will investigate how hymns, as carriers and interpreters of 2000 years of Christian faith, have laid their biblical foundation, and have incorporated historical and cultural elements as well as their respective musical styles to enrich the liturgy and shape our spirituality. It will also examine how the hymn explosion of the latter part of 20th century has opened up a new world of 21st century hymnology, which on the one hand has incorporated new vocabularies to deal with issues of human rights, social, economical and political justice, ecology and integrity of creation, and on the other hand has adapted musical languages of the modern world with diversified ethnic styles that has formed a new world of 21st century global hymns. Emphasis will be placed on the analysis and application of contemporary hymns and praise choruses musically, theologically and liturgically."
"This course aims at familiarizing the students with the practical theology movement in the past several decades.
