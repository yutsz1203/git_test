"The first part of this course introduces the sources, chemical nature and environmental effects of major environmental toxicants. The second part covers the fundamental basis of toxic action of chemical substances including environmental toxicants on living systems. The third part provides students an understanding of the basic principles and biochemical mechanisms of toxicology. This course will also cover the basic concepts of biomonitoring and ecotoxicology."
"Students will conduct practical work including multiple cytotoxicity assay, DNA damage assay, and biomarker assays in laboratory. The practical lab helps students understand the lecture taught in ENSC3520. Students will also be introduced with internationally recognized methods to study how chemicals can have biochemical and ecological impacts as a global citizen. Students are also encouraged to use innovative ideas to design new methods to test chemical toxicity."
"This course discusses the techniques and procedures of evaluating environmental consequences arising from human activities, with focus on their application in Hong Kong as prescribed under the Hong Kong Environmental Impact Assessment Ordinance, and its Technical Memorandum. Students are encouraged to take the laboratory course (ENSC4242) together with the lecture in order to have a better integration of theories and practical experiences on the subject."
This laboratory course accompanies the lecture course ENSC4240 and provides hands-on exercises on selected techniques used in environmental impact assessment (EIA). Students will critically review a current EIA report with respect to its soundness in the application of EIA methodologies and the evaluation of assessment results. They will also gain first-hand experience on how to carry out an EIA by working on a small scale EIA project focusing on specific components of impact assessment.
This advanced course revolves around the concept of environmental health and aims to provide students the tools to evaluate and quantify the impact of pollution and climate change on both the health of humans and the environment. Students will build on their acquired knowledge to develop advanced interdisciplinary methods to tackle emerging cases related to environmental health.
"This course is designed to extend students’ understanding of and develop their ability in the application of various aspects of environmental chemistry in relation to the major types of air and water pollution associated with industrial and vehicle emissions. It outlines the basic processes in bleaching and dyeing, electroplating and food processing that give rise to water pollution and application of physico-chemical techniques in controlling such pollution. It also examines combustion processes and the associated applications and limitations of the absorption, adsorption, oxidation-reduction and catalytic conversion techniques in relation toaerial emissions from furnaces and vehicles. Site visits will be arranged where possible to enhance students’ ability in application."
"This course introduces the principles and applications of various chemical and physiochemical processes applicable for treatment and control of air and water pollution. It studies the processes of neutralization, oxidation-reduction, chemical precipitation, coagulation, flocculation, physical separation, absorption, adsorption, filtration, chemical disinfection, solvent extraction, fractional distillation and incineration. It also examines the applicabilities and limitations of such processes with reference to the treatment and recovery of toxic and hazardous chemical wastes. Site visits will be arranged to enhance students’ ability in application."
"In this course, students carry out an independent research project either provided by the supervisor or jointly decided with the student. To fulfill the course requirement, students are required to discuss their progress with their supervisors regularly and submit a research proposal."
"In this course, students carry out an independent laboratory research project either provided by the supervisor or jointly decided with the student. Students are required to discuss their progress with their supervisor(s) regularly and submit a progress report at the end of the term.
