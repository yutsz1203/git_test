"This lecture based course will cover important aspects of the development of a research protocol in public health research including how to identify a meaningful and feasible research topic, how to perform a thorough literature search, ethical considerations, questionnaire design, and sample size estimation."
This course continues the process of guiding the students in the development of their research protocol through individual discussions between the students and their supervisors and student presentations to their fellow students and supervisors. The presentation groups will be formed consisting of about 6-9 students and 3 supervisors. The supervisors will provide feedback and advice to the students on the development of their protocol.
"Students will conduct the fieldwork and collect the required data for the thesis. This will enable them to apply the principles learnt in class into practice to deal with the practical matters regarding data collection. The data collection skills involved include determination of the variables to be measured, design of measurement instruments, validation of the instruments, and conduct of the fieldwork (of measurement). Students also need to present the progress of research."
Students will continue conducting and complete the data analysis and complete the writing up of the thesis. They need to apply the skills of scientific writing learnt in the research thesis.
