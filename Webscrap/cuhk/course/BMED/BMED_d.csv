"This is the first of a series of two related courses on curriculum and teaching methods in mathematics, with a focus on Hong Kong school context. These two courses aim to help students to be familiar with the current curricular issues and develop essential pedagogical skills and strategies in mathematics. Throughout these two courses, the students will have hands-on practice opportunities which aim to help students to reflect on their own teaching beliefs and teaching styles in mathematics. The first course focuses on developing the general knowledge and skills a teacher needs for organizing an effective mathematics lesson. A wide range of general topics of mathematics pedagogy will be covered, including: aims and objectives of mathematics education; the evolution of mathematics curricula in the current educational reform; theories of mathematics learning and instruction; models of mathematics teaching; preparation of mathematics lessons and classroom techniques through microteaching; use of instructional aids and manipulatives; catering for learning diversities; and evaluation of learning effectiveness."

It covers a wide range of topics related to this area, including: development of mathematical literacy for all through approaches of mathematical exploration, understanding, reasoning, and communication; development of mathematical problem solving abilities; and analysis of misconception and cognitive difficulties encountered in the development of mathematical skills and ability in students."
"This course focuses on the teaching of algebra and calculus in school mathematics. Ranging from the basic concept of introducing unknowns and designation of numbers by symbols at primary school level to systems of algebraic equations or equations of higher degrees at upper secondary level, algebraic methods permeate through the whole school mathematics curriculum. In this course, topics of algebra and calculus in the mathematics curriculum are analyzed from multiple perspectives in terms of the mathematics content knowledge, psychology of learning, pedagogical approaches, and epistemological relationships between mathematical concepts involved. Emphasis is placed on how students can develop their algebraic and calculus ways of thinking gradually through the curriculum. Through different learning activities that include the use of information technology resources, student teachers will develop their conceptual understanding and frameworks for effective instructional design in these curriculum topics."

"This course focuses on an important aspect in mathematics education, namely, the understanding and cultivation of number and number sense, which is a major aim in primary school mathematics education. It is concerned about school children’s learning of basic quantitative skills, from counting objects to the four rules of arithmetic, both in exact calculations and in estimation. In this course, related topics in the mathematics curriculum are analysed from multiple perspectives, that is, in terms of the mathematics content knowledge, psychology of learning, pedagogical approaches, and epistemological relationships between mathematical concepts involved. Through different learning activities which include the implementation of available information technology resources, student teachers will develop their conceptual skills and frameworks for effective instructional design in curriculum topics related to number and number sense."
"The famous mathematician Felix Klein pointed out that there is a disconnection between university mathematics education and elementary mathematics education. He called this phenomenon “double discontinuity”. As a student of B.Ed. in Mathematics and Mathematics Education and a pre-service secondary mathematics teacher, there is a need to break through this phenomenon. This is precisely the focus of this course. In this course, the connection between university mathematics and secondary school mathematics are analyzed from multiple perspectives, that is, in terms of the mathematics content knowledge, psychology of learning, pedagogical approaches, and epistemological relationships between mathematical concepts involved. Through different learning activities, student teachers will review different dimensions of secondary school mathematics curriculum, including algebra, geometry, statistics and calculus, from an advanced standpoint. Their pedagogical content knowledge in mathematics will be developed."
"This course focuses on the teaching of probability and statistics in school mathematics. At primary school level, statistics is introduced in relation to real life applications. At higher grade levels, statistics is taught with more computational elements and their interpretations, and real-world experiences in probabilistic events are basis for developing a formal understanding of probability in mathematics. In this course, topics in probability and statistics in the mathematics curriculum are analysed from multiple perspectives, that is, in terms of the mathematics content knowledge, pedagogical approaches, and epistemological relationships between mathematical concepts involved. Emphasis is on the development of stochastic thinking among school students.

"The Independent Study is an elective course during the final year of our BEd. Programme. It has a course weighting of 3 credit units. The workload and expectations are similar to those of the equivalent number of one course. It aims to develop the student’s ability to conduct independent research in the area of mathematics and mathematics education. The development, undertaking and completion of the Study are the culmination of the BEd. learning experience and the student must take and pass the course of BMED4510 Action Research in Mathematics Classroom (數學教學行動研究) prior to enrolling to this course. It is intended to be a largely independent piece of work, which is aimed at combining and utilizing the research skills and knowledge developed and gained from other relevant previous courses, and using these to complete a piece of original research within the student’s area of interest. The course structure of Independent Study I (BMED4910) is same as Independent Study II (BMED4920) and the latter serves as an extension of the former."
