"This pre-capstone course uses a ‘writing-to-learn’ approach that guides student step-by-step through the making of a primary research article in the life science discipline. The course introduces students to the process of problem solving in science through the scientific method of inquiry. The underlying principles of commonly used life-science methodologies for conducting research will be introduced through lectures while practical training in literature survey, information gathering, and data analysis will be provided through hands-on experience. The course will also introduce techniques in scientific communications by guiding students through each stage of the writing process and by conducting oral presentations, group discussion and peer reviews."

In addition, the training in aseptic cell culturing techniques to handle E. coli, plant and mammalian cell lines is provided for the skill preparation of the subsequent transient expression, establishment of transgenic plants and cell lines carrying the previously constructed recombinant DNA clones.Students’ progress will be evaluated through records of data analysis and evaluation in experimental logbooks, laboratory write-up and a final lab report in addition to quizzes and exams at term’s end. Students will also be divided into groups to produce a science video illustrating a Cell and Molecular Biology related topic of their own interests. Students are expected to demonstrate team-spirit through division of labor in the project as well as to learn and communicate science through self-motivated pursuit of knowledge."
"This laboratory course is a continuation of CMBI3010 Cell and Molecular Biology Laboratory I. This laboratory course provides practical experience in the studies of cell biology. Project-based experimental projects are designed to guide students through the investigative process of scientific research. Different from traditional lab courses, which consist of separate and unrelated exercises, this CMB lab course is offered as term-long projects with all techniques or experimental methods incorporated into each project. Students will therefore not only learn various modern techniques, but also how and when these techniques are applied in life science research. In addition to the transgenic plant cell lines established in CMBI3010, this course will introduce students to transient expressions in animal cell models. Cell imaging approach employing high-end methodologies in microscopy to detect the expression and sub-cellular localization of fluorescent proteins as well as organelle dynamics will be used. Hands-on experience on conventional experimental methods including protein purification, Western blotting analysis and other common in-vivo or in-vitro cellular assays will also be provided."

"This course provides intensive training on literature reading and analysis in cell and molecular biology. Following CMBI2200, the first STOT course offered, a group of students are assigned to individual teachers for more direct and closer supervision. Students choose and work on the subjects of their interest, and the project involves intensive literature reading and discussions with the supervisor. Students are required to identify major questions or problems in cell and molecular biology fields. A literature review and an oral presentation for the identified questions or problems are assessed at term end."
"This course provides an overview on the phylogeny and basic biology of selected top model organisms including mouse, zebrafish, fruit-fly, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, and yeast. Due to their biological and technical advantages, these model organisms have been extensively employed for discovering a series of fundamental biological questions in the research of the modern life sciences. The course is instructed by our faculty members and invited speakers from other universities who use these models extensively in their researches."
"This course is the continuation of its pre-requisite CMBI3100. Regarding the questions addressed in CMBI3100, students learn how to prepare a research proposal under supervision by the same teacher. In addition to the scientific writing and oral communication, the main focus is on the proposal writing, including question identification, idea/hypothesis formulation, organization, and language usage. Performance is evaluated by the proposal and an oral defense at term end."
"This course covers the general principles of and current developments in protein trafficking for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Specific topics include the structures and functions of transport vesicles, receptor-mediated protein transport, protein compartmentation in the secretory and endocytic pathways as well as in other organelles, protein degradation and the biological consequences of protein mis-localization in organisms. Students are required to watch online Lecture Videos in KEEP or Blackboard about Basic Knowledge in protein trafficking prior to the Lectures. These online Lecture Videos are supplemented with online quizzes in which students need to finish after watching these videos. In addition, students will also watch videos discussing recent Research Papers. During lectures, students will have in-depth discussion regarding the questions, key concepts and up-to-date research. By these means students will be able to clarify their concepts and be familiar with the latest research findings that are related to protein trafficking. Students will also learn the current developments of protein trafficking in details by delivering a presentation on a relevant topic derived from a recent research paper, with a Q&A session. The presentation will be graded by both Professor and peer students.Blended-mode class section is available for this course. Please refer to the “Class Notes” of the blended-mode class section for details."
