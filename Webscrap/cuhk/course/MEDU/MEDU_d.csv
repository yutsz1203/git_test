"Medical schools strive to educate knowledgeable, caring and professional physicians. The growing interest in empathy, wellness and resilience has fuelled the design and implementation of structured educational programmes worldwide to cultivate empathy, especially when there is a globally increasing trend in professional burnout among undergraduates and resident trainees. Empathy in the medical setting includes appreciating the patient's emotions and the expression of that awareness. Empathy is an essential learning objective that can be cultivated. Empathy brings about patient satisfaction, promotes adherence to medical recommendations and good clinical outcomes, and more importantly, professional satisfaction. A key component of empathy is reflective capacity. Fostering reflective capacity within medical education helps develop critical thinking skills, inform clinical reasoning, and enhance professionalism among trainees. The development of reflective capacity is conducive to effective feedback in medical education and is an essential aspect of self-regulated and lifelong learning. Failure to reflect on one's thinking processes, including a critical examination of one's assumptions, beliefs, and conclusions, was recently described as a cognitive component of ""physician overconfidence,"" a contributing cause of diagnostic error in medicine. Reflection is not necessarily intuitive, especially in students at the initial stages of their medical careers. The over-arching aim of the course is to nurture and consolidate the key soft skills of an effective doctor and a healthy resilient personality through the development of reflective capacity and empathy.The course is delivered in progressive stages to build reflective capacity and empathy in specific professional developmental contexts. The four building blocks, as outlined below, will be emphasized in different years. The building blocks will be progressively built and integrated over the curriculum from years 2 to 4.1. Empathic Engagement (Year 2)2. Doctor and Society (Year 3)3. Doctor and Self- Reflection in Practice (Year 4)4. Doctor and Profession (Year 4)The four components encompass the core values of a healthy and competent doctor who can foster a therapeutic alliance with patients, appreciate and reflect the meaning of work, be a team player, and connect with the public and society.Attendance to the empathic engagement workshop is mandatory."
