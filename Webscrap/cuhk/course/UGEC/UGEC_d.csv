"This course provides an overview of the key challenges of the world population [in the 21st century]. For example, aging or overpopulation in urban cities, environmental degradation, food and water resource crisis, large-scale voluntary and involuntary migration, and spread of communicable disease. A key goal of the course is to map out the linkages between population patterns, trends, and some of the socio-economic issues that occur locally, nationally, and at the global level which bring great challenges to our society. You will learn the concepts, theories, and data essential in the scientific study of the size, composition, and spatial distribution of human populations; and the changes that occur in these phenomena through the processes of fertility, mortality, and migration. You will gain an understanding of the roots of population structures, processes, and the consequences for individuals, family, and societies, and how it will affect and be affected by natural resources availability or depletion and health care system. Students will acquire the basic ability to analyze, explain and present the potential crisis facing the population system. In particular, this course will stimulate students’ interest in understanding how the population could be linked to sustainable development, and reflect on the relationship between population growth and availability of resources, as well as the relationship between population and social institutional arrangements such as child and old care support, job supply and public asset distribution. In the end, students will learn to apply their skill and knowledge in proposing solutions for solving population-related challenges for achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), for example, zero hunger and no poverty, good health and well-being, reducing social inequality including gender inequality, maintaining decent work and economic development while developing more sustainable cities and communities."
"Gender inequalities often stem from distinctions either empirically grounded or socially constructed. “History” is of essential importance in understanding how these inequalities are constructed in different periods and different contexts. This course traces and examines the history of women in China from the late Qing period to the present. Discover and analyze the sex roles, sexual politics and sexual symbolism in the course of modernization and nation building, how they are related to economic development, ideological shifts and colonialism, and to find out how they functioned to reduce gender distinctions (SDG#10 Reduced Inequalities), how they affected the formulation and changes of women policy (SDG#16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions), and how they promoted woman’s rights and social changes (SDG#5 Gender Equality)."
"(UGEC2042 is double-coded with CURE2016.)  This course is an introduction to the formation of modernity in relation to various aspects of urban culture. Tracing the development of cities and the urban cultures evolved within the new urban development since the 19th Century, cities such as Paris, London, New York will serve as 'texts' for analysis. Architecture, urban planning, artistic and intellectual movements as well as modes of everyday life in urban living are studied to demonstrate how the modern ways of thinking, seeing and living come into being. The course will also focus on the specificity of Hong Kong's experience in urban development and its adaptation of 'modernity' during a process of urbanization. The course will employ a wide range of visual images and audio-visual materials to explain the dynamism between modernity and urban culture."
"The universal appeal of classical music is masked by a troubled past. It is a complex story of white colonization by European powers, spanning centuries and continents. Classical music has its own colonial baggage, too, with links to slavery profits and other problematic phenomena, whether in the gendered tradition of the “great composers,” or in a thriving piano industry of the early 20th century, which resulted in forced labor and countless deaths in the colonial ivory trade, or in the transnational circulation of opera in and beyond the 19th century, which would not have been possible without the port city networks of rapidly expanding empires. Importantly, such legacies have led to new forms of advocacy aimed at decolonizing classical music today. This SDG-GE course will examine how current practices around the world, on the back of complex and violent histories, attempt to democratize classical music in lockstep with the needs and concerns of contemporary society. What does it mean to decolonize musically in the 21st century, recenter marginalized individuals and groups in classical music, and make classical music more sustainable and reflective of a fair society? These questions run through the three themed sections of the syllabus: i) gender and representation, ii) equality, diversity, inclusion, iii) institutions and justice. We will explore related ideas and concepts, in connection with past contexts and present practices, including orchestras, opera companies, community projects, and social enterprises. By drawing on a variety of perspectives, we will discuss how and why decolonizing classical music matters, to whom, along with its ongoing challenges for improving and enhancing equity.  This course engages directly with SDGs 5, 10, and 16. Through the three themed sections, we will assess how classical music practices today can be observed to respond to the identified SDGs, particularly in terms of further empowering indigenous women musicians, reducing age-old inequalities, and promoting greater social justice from within institutions that can better reflect the untold tales and human experiences of classical music.  Neither score-reading nor prior musical knowledge is required for this course."
"(UGEC2171 is double-coded with GRMD2401.)  Sustainable development is a global vision for the future. This approach to development should not only generate economic growth, but also distribute its benefits equitably, regenerate the environment rather than destroy it, as well as empower people rather than marginalize them. The UN 2030 Agenda came into effect in 2015 promising to “interlink and integrate” Sustainable Development Goals in an attempt to implement solutions facing humanity. Sustainable development goals are an all-inclusive invitation to act to end poverty, secure the planet and ensure that all people appreciate peace and prosperity.This course introduces the concept of sustainable development, the evolution of models and the implicit assumptions they make, as well as their contradictions. It also traces the advent of the SDGs and the extent that they support the principles of sustainable development. We examine the emergence of environmental problems and critically review the institutional responses to these problems since the late 1960s. We then consider in detail the increasingly popular idea of efforts in the pursuit of the SDGs from different perspectives that centres around people, planet, prosperity, peace and the partnerships involved in achieving the goals. The lectures will explore how achieving sustainable development goals will depends much on effective planning and good governance. Examples from different parts of the world will be used to underline the tight inter-connections between processes in different regions and across geographical scales in the context of sustainable development."
"(UGEC2188 is double-coded with ENGE2530.) The objective of this course is to give students an overview of the status, features, and use of Hong Kong English (HKE), the variety of English commonly used in Hong Kong. In the first part of the course, students will be introduced to the concept of ‘world Englishes’ and examine different theoretical frameworks for conceptualizing the evolution of new varieties of English. The course then examines relationship between Hong Kong English and Hong Kong culture from cultural, social, historical, and educational perspectives, particularly in relation to and juxtaposition from Cantonese and Putonghua. The second part of the course examines both spoken and written features of HKE, including grammar, discourse particles, vocabulary, and pronunciation, as well as the practices of code-mixing and code-switching. This section of the course also focuses on the social impact of the use of these features in Hong Kong culture. In the third part of the course, language attitudes and ideologies towards ‘standard’ language varieties (for example American and British English) in relation to HKE will be explored. The course will also examine the relationship between use of HKE and social identity as well as gender in Hong Kong culture."
"(UGEC2189 is double-coded with ENGE2600.) Although English has long spread around the world, the consequences of this spread are only now beginning to be appreciated by speakers in diverse cultures and societies. English has changed the world, impacting specific local cultures in both positive and negative ways. But English has also been localized and acculturated, made to express the realities of diverse cultures and societies, and so the language has been changed in turn. The discourse of world Englishes aims to re-imagine our understanding of the language. The difference between error and innovation can no longer be decided by reference to ‘ownership’ of the language. Additionally, the language is beginning to be a medium of the expression of identity for more and more people in very different social and cultural contexts. World English must be pluralized, which is why we think in terms of world Englishes. This course is split into two sections. The first section will introduce you to issues in the discourse of world Englishes: innovation, variety, creativity, globalization, etc. The second section will look at specific case studies in different cultures and societies, and will focus on Asian Englishes, e.g. English in Singapore, China, and Japan. Different Asian cultures have distinct historical experiences with English, leading to different levels of cultural penetration (e.g. in popular culture) and depth of function (e.g. in business and law). The second section looks at different examples to explore their specific cultural engagements with the English language, but also to identify what they have in common: Japan English and Singlish develop in very different cultures, but the course with emphasis comparison as well as contrast."
"The first part of the course will cover the general introductory concepts and provide students with theoretical and historical background of the discipline. This will be followed by in-depth study of specific environmental settings and resource issues that will complement our understanding of ecotourism. Hong Kong is the main focus of discussion though examples or cases in Mainland China and around the world are also provided throughout the course. Critical issues in ecotourism such as its multi-dimensional impacts, governance, planning, and resource and visitor management will also be covered. Lastly, students will be exposed to the relation of the phenomenon of ecotourism and the concept of sustainable tourism. Some of the lectures will address SDGs, for example, Goals 12, 16 and 17 embrace the knowledge and evolution of environmentalism and nature-human relationship; Goals 14 and 15 connect with the concept of protected areas and environmental conservation; Goals 1, 3, 5, 8, 11, 12 and 13 cover multi-dimensional tourism impacts and, more importantly, climate change issue. The concept of sustainable development will frame and conclude the entire course since the concepts has played an indispensable role in tourism development nowadays."
"The pursuit of ideal living environment has long been a human undertaking throughout history. Because of environmental variations, some places are definitely better than the others for living and development. In the ancient time, man strived for searching a nice place for settlement which could provide a better resource base. Nowadays, man acquires sciences and technologies to change or even create the environment that makes living pleasant and comfortable. This course provides students with the insights needed to gain an understanding of ideal environment for living from a geographical perspective. Topics include environmental perception, siting and location, urbanization, land use and functions, urban planning, urban design, architecture and interior design. As the course examines the understanding of ideal environment for living from different angles, students will not only gain objective geographical knowledge about the relationship between man and environment, but also learn how some urban challenges and issues are tackled. While the coverage will be broad and pluralistic, examples and cases of mainland China and Hong Kong will be emphasized. In order to enhance the learning experience, an interactive teaching mode will be adopted in the lectures so that the instructors can guide students to analyze the cases and issues through queries and answers."
"Food is essential for life by providing energy and nutrition and achieving zero hunger is one of 17 Sustainable Development Goals in the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Ironically, world hunger is increasing and FAO’s most recent estimates put the number of hungry people at 822 million in 2018-19, an increase of more than 28 million since 2014-16, even though the technology of food production has improved significantly. Why? It is because the causes of world hunger are multiple and, in principle, include food availability, accessibility and utilization. The course therefore adopts a multidisciplinary approach to examine the different issues of food and hunger, and how they change with time. The causes of world hunger will be analyzed with special emphasis on food production systems, bearing in mind there is no single solution to the problem. Towards the end of the course, the development of sustainable agriculture and measures to mitigate the hunger problem in the 21st century will be addressed to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Lectures will be supplemented with case studies, videos and slides."
"Popular representations of the African continent produced in global discussions are marked by a stereotyped image of Africa, its culture, environment and development. The purpose of this course is to critically examine the common framing of Africa as a continent of conflict, disasters, poverty and a region that is perpetually in need of external intervention. In addition to the myth that surrounds Africa, there is a growing dynamics of activities resulting into the current interest on the continent. Earlier, the UN settled on the Agenda 2030 as a plan of action for people, planet and prosperity for the whole world. This plan dovetails very well with the Africa’s Agenda 2063. This therefore provides an opportunity to identify where Africa situates on SDG issues that include its people, its environment and its economic development.The course will therefore present to students the context of Africa relating to its geography, environment, culture as well as contemporary development issues shaping the destiny of Africa. Through lectures, guest speakers, videos and possibly field studies, students will be able to critically evaluate the stereotypical notion of Africa as a continent rather than as a country as is quite often misconstrued. The course will provide an intellectual platform to understand and analyze issues from a multi-disciplinary perspective as they relate to Africa and humanity. The students will be able to interpret and explain in broad terms, the contemporary position of Africa as it relates to other parts of the world with special attention to its relationship with Asia and China in particular."
"Cities have always been magnets attracting a growing number of citizens. The unprecedented pace of urbanization has recently witnessed a historic shift of human population with the majority now living in cities. The growth of cities in this age of globalization raises many opportunities and challenges, concerning the quality of life, poverty, sustainability, environmental degradation and urban competitiveness. All of which deserve our attention.This course offers students a comprehensive understanding of cities and urban challenges from the perspective of sustainable development. It examines the historical, social, economic, cultural and environmental dimensions of cities. As the course focuses on urban issues at global, regional and local levels, students will not only gain knowledge about the causes and impacts of urban problems, but also learn how different stakeholders can help achieve sustainable liveable cities in the age of globalization. By adopting an issue-based approach, different SDGs such as no poverty (SDG 1), industry, innovation and infrastructure (SDG 9), reduced inequality (SDG 10) and sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11), will be included in a variety of topics ranging from socio-economic to environmental aspects in the course.

"(UGEC2351 is double-coded with GLSD2201.) Culture is in the air that we breathe and it is inevitable that people construct reality through their own 'cultural lens'. However, in this globalization era, people often have many cultural lenses. Through understanding the impact of globalization on cultures and societies, we will have nuanced understanding of how people from different cultures construct reality. Many scholars and activists argue that globalization will lead to a worldwide homogenized consumer culture dominated by Western values. Others believe that globalization can lead to the clashes of incorrigible cultures. Meanwhile, globalization has catalyzed formation of new hybrid cultures and fostered the blooming of creative cultural industries. In this course, we will explore the above topics through understanding the effects of globalization on personal identities, the economy, consumerism, and communication, etc. in the immediate and distal environment."

"(UGEC2636 is double-coded with COMM2813.) With the advent of the new media technology, new forms of organizational crisis emerge. They are called Internet-mediated crises. A major difference between the Internet-mediated crises and the traditional crises lies in the intensive interactivity, collectivity, simultaneity and dialogic sphericity of the former. This very nature of Internet-mediated crisis makes it all the more hard to handle. A specialized and critical function of the public relations practice is the management of crisis. This course covers two major levels. The first level takes on a functionalism approach to crisis management. The second level takes on a more critical approach in public relations. Students will learn how crisis reflects complicity and dynamism between citizens and organizations in modern societies.

"(UGEC2665 is double-coded with ANTH2540.) This course addresses the ways in which social media and other related interactions in cyberspace have become a central element in the everyday lives of humans across the globe in the 21st Century. Our modern lives are now largely interwoven with digital technologies that have not only changed our own cultures, but also have brought forth new cultural forms through mobile phone technologies, networked “smart”-products, and cultural groupings only possible through digital means. The course approaches the anthropology of these digital cultures through its main themes—the transformation and expansion of social media, social research online, the intermixing of our online and offline lives, critical social issues of online lives, and the question of posthumanism. These themes are addressed explicitly in the course, and are also the subtexts of the different lectures, readings, and project work. Students will learn the techniques of online fieldwork and referencing. They will explore a diverse array of new ethnographies on social media: on gender, political movements, online dating, hacking, and gaming culture. These ethnographies also serve to model online social research and provide examples of methodology and design. The social consequences of cyberspace are addressed in the topics of internet pornography, addiction, surveillance, activism, and social networking. Gender and identity issues are a continuous theme throughout the course, highlighting how online lives accentuate already existing dynamics. Hong Kong connections to these subjects will also be critically discussed, often drawing on topical themes presented on blogs and forums. Students will learn of the philosophical questions of posthumanism and the nature of technologically mediated human culture. This serves as a philosophical ballast to the course allowing students to reflect personally on their own experiences and how technology has and will continue to shape their lives. The role of anthropology in understanding and capturing human culture in this context anchors on the investigation of how technology is possibly making us ‘more’ human than previous forms of cultural life."
"(UGEC2667 is double-coded with ANTH2320.) How can we understand the minds of other people? Do people in different cultures or societies feel and think in different ways? How do childhood experiences affect people and shape or even determine what kinds of persons they will become? What is it like to be mentally abnormal or even pathological? Do people in different cultures or societies experience, understand, and treat psychopathology in different ways? This course examines psychological experiences—feelings, perceptions, thoughts, and motivations—from social and cross-cultural perspectives. It sets out to explore the intersection between anthropology, a field that typically turns to the exotic other, and psychology, a field that often takes the universality of mental activities and mechanisms for granted. Specific focus is placed upon how ethnographers, clinicians, and researchers with training in both fields grapple with various mental phenomena and different ways of understanding them. As most of the materials are drawn from psychological anthropology, this course also serves as an eclectic introduction to this subfield, which was once influential in the history of American anthropology."

"This course explores some of the major issues concerning the role of the youth and the problems confronting them in modern society. The nature of the conventional wisdom of the “youth problem” is critically examined, with the help of concepts and theories in sociology and related fields. By the end of the course, students are expected to gain more understanding of the nature of the phenomenon of problematization of youth, and to look beyond common sense or public perception on current social issues related to the youth in modern society. More importantly, youth problems can jeopardize the sustainable development of youth. [For example, education inequality (SDG4 Quality Education) and inadequate school-to-work transition (SDG8 Decent Work and Economic Growth) could impact on youth poverty (SDG1 No Poverty) as a result.] A broader and deeper understanding of various facets of problematization can inform how youth should be empowered to attain sustainable development in modern society."

"This course examines the social issues of animal from the philosophical perspectives. What are the key differences humans and other animals? Is it ethical to raise and slaughter animals for food, conduct tests on, and buying or keeping animals as pets? How ought one to respond to unethical laws on animals? What are the social impacts of these actions? Students will develop an interdisciplinary perspective in the fields of animal studies, ethical theory, sociology and environmental philosophy by understanding how ancient and contemporary philosophers, sociologist, environmental scientists, ecologists, activists, and journalists have responded to key ethical questions concerning animal rights and its social implication. Topics to be discussed include: animal-machines, ethical meat eating, radical vegetarianism, and the evolution of pets.This course bears on several of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By transforming our attitude towards and relationship with animal, we enjoy the mental health benefits of a deepened appreciation of and connection with them (SDG#3 Good Health and Well-Being). By exploring the key difference between human and animals, we deepen our understand toward ourself and different species on earth (SDG#14 Life below water & SDG#15 Life on land). Finally, by reimagining our relationship with animal, we can envision for a just society in which all species could co-exist peacefully (SDG#16 Peace, Justice and Strong institutions)."

"When money is fiat, land is scarce, housing becomes a good hedge of inflation. However, when housing is both an investment capital as well as a necessity, the city is split into an owner-renter dichotomy, with the former preferring an increase of housing prices but just the opposite for the latter. When the pendulum of housing price swings to one side, housing capital can result in negative equity, asset bubble, or even financial crisis. Swinging to the other end, housing can become unaffordable, even if public housing or subsidy can be provided. Decent living environment and sustainable community are the concerns of cities. This introduction course explores the reasons of the housing price fluctuations and the implications of the dichotomy on the city lives."
"(UGEC2917 is double-coded with URSP2010.)  The Belt and Road initiative (BRI) refers to the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road.

"(UGEC2950 is double-coded with ANTH2380.)  This course pays attention to the environment and its relation with human experiences. Through the lens of environment, we bring human diversity into presence, examining ways of life of peoples—from Indonesia highlander to Tokyo urbanites—and their words and deeds to tackle crises of planetary scale—climate change, nuclear disaster, air pollution, waste, deforestation. Facing these crises, can anthropological inquiry of the environment help us to explore a humanity that can accommodate living beings of all kind? How can such inquiry inspire us to make changes that create a world we can live together? We’ll follow these trails in the environment to look for engagement and conversation: cultural perception on the origin of agriculture, resource use and religious belief, debating traditional ecological knowledge, globalization and state intervention, environmental justice, land dispossession, waste and pollution, disaster and extreme environment. Through ethnographies of people who are struggling to survive, this course asks why they are pushed into poverty, how their resources being exploited, what they do to fight for justice; it covers SDGs related to the issues of sustainable agriculture (SDG2), tacking climate change (SDG13) and promoting peace, justice and institutional accountability (SDG16)."
"(UGEC2960 is double-coded with ANTH2340.)  This course will examine phenomena often viewed as irrational and superstitious to see how they can be understood in cultural terms. All societies have some beliefs in another world, yet beliefs vary widely between societies. The course will examine traditional anthropological topics such as magic, traditional healing, divination, fengshui, witchcraft, and ghosts, as well as more recent issues such as ESP, psychokinesis, qigong, vampires, zombies, monsters, UFOs and alien abduction. The role of myth in modern society and the cultural creation of reality will be highlighted. The power of a cultural approach in explaining the supernatural and the limits of what science can explain will also be discussed."
"(UGEC2963 is double-coded with SOCI2216.)  China’s opening to the world has led to not only massive social and economic transformations, but also the emergence of social problems. This course explores some of these social problems, especially since the economic reform after 1978. The nature of these social problems and their possible causes will be critically examined, in the context of modernization, with the help of related concepts and theories in sociology. By the end of the course, students are expected to have a basic understanding of the major social problems in contemporary China and their implications for social and economic developments of China in the future."
"(UGEC2970 is double-coded with ANTH2330.)  This course focuses on gender in the Asian region. A comparative approach will be taken to reflect diversity and resemblance, continuity and discontinuity, and historical and contemporary influences on gender within countries in the Asian region. Societies studied may vary from year to year, and may include Hong Kong, mainland China, India, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Chinese across societies. Gender issues and conditions will be examined within different contexts, covering such areas as language, class, work, family and kinship, health, sexuality, education, religion, development and politics."
"(UGEC2983 is double-coded with SOCI2116.)  Students enrolled in this cross-disciplinary course will address three basic questions: “why do people become criminals”, “who makes criminal law”, and “how is criminal law enforced”. Specifically, this course will include topics such as the social causes of criminal behaviour, the role of criminal law in social control, and the operation of the criminal justice system (their internal interaction and external interaction with other social organizations). Comparative and local empirical research will also be drawn to explore the crime problems and the development of criminal law and the criminal justice system in USA, PRC, Taiwan and Hong Kong. In addition, to strengthen the students’ understandings on the current criminal justice system, students will be given one field opportunity to directly experience police departments, courts or prisons in Hong Kong."
"(UGEC2990 is double-coded with ANTH2520.)  Globalization is economically transforming the world, as national borders become increasingly irrelevant before the global flow of money and goods. But globalization also has a great impact on cultures across the globe, as products from Coca-Cola to iPods, and ideas from human rights to ideals of beauty to ideologies of terrorism, intrude everywhere. This course examines how globalization is fundamentally transforming the meanings of culture. The course objectives are to enable students: (1) to have greater insight into the processes of “the globalization of culture""”, and (2) to better understand the nature of their own culture and selves within a globalizing world."
"Health is a fundamental aspect of human existence. We all want good health, effective treatments of illness and affordable health care. Yet we are faced with many challenges and controversies in our pursuit of good health: glaring inequality in health and longevity, the prevalence of unhealthy lifestyle, the conflicts between patients and doctors, the uncertainty of medical treatments and medical knowledge, and the ever-increasing health care spending. In this course, we dissect these issues from the perspectives of social sciences. We first assess the social determinants of health and illness and examine the following topics: the social distribution of health and illness, societal inequality and health, social networks, social capital and health, health lifestyle and public policy, and the interaction between genetics and social environment. We then address the social organization of health and health care and discuss the following topics: the social construction of health and illness, the social context of patient-doctor relationship, and the social organization of healthcare systems. Throughout the course, we will emphasize the current COVID-19 pandemic and use it to illustrate how social and cultural factors influence health and well-being. This course helps the students understand and relate to the following UN sustainable development goals: SDG#3 good health and well-being, SDG#10 reduced inequalities and peace, SDG#16 justice and strong institutions. By illuminating the social and cultural determinants of health and well-being, this course will enrich the students’ understanding of what contributed to good health and well-being, of the unequal distribution of health and well-being, and of the role of social and political institutions in producing health. It also seeks to motivate the students to think about public policies and social interventions that may promote health and well-being, reduce social disparities in health and strengthen health-promoting institutions.

"(UGEC3203 is double-coded with GDRS3005.)  This interdisciplinary course introduces and examines gender and sexuality from a contemporary and regional perspective. Based on a cross-cultural perspective, we will read and analyze different meanings of gender and sexuality, and how these meanings are constructed. In a context of modernization campaigns and globalization processes, this course illustrates how gender relations and sexual politics are related with historical backgrounds, cultural heritage, market expansion, ideological shifts, and capitalist dynamics. The topics of gender and sexuality will be interwoven with that of migration, work, family, popular culture, mass media, and consumerism. The course will help students to understand issues of discrimination against women and girls, unpaid care and domestic work, access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, and equal rights to economic resources, and to reflect on how to promote gender equality (SDG5 among 17 Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs, in the 2030 development agenda). Students will be encouraged to explore localized knowledge and living experiences of gender and sexuality, and to think critically about how to reduce inequality (SDG10) related to social systems of sex and gender."
"(UGEC3204 is double-coded with GDRS3006.)  Living Feminisms is all about how to put feminism into practice. Specifically, it is concerned with living out feminist consciousness in every step of making fundamental and lasting social change. With this in mind, Living Feminisms is not an exposition of feminist theories per se but an exploration of how social change effort would look like when we take up feminist consciousness that transcends separateness and duality. It explores the root causes that lead to the domination system that has plagued humanity for centuries, examines the possibility of having a fundamental and lasting social transformation that supports life of all, and takes a closer look at a few selected alternative practices such as restorative justice and sharing economies that hold out hope in times of crises. The course also equips students with practical knowledge of being a change agent, introducing some practices with feminist consciousness that transform limiting beliefs about social change, nourish resilience by taking care of social and political trauma, and cultivate need-based facilitation skills and leadership that help navigate conflicts in the process of making internal as well as external transformation. To put it in a nutshell, Living Feminisms is a course that cultivates change agents with feminist consciousness.Living Feminisms deeply resonates with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 as a blueprint for building a sustainable future by 2030. The course directly touches on alternative practices working towards the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 10 (Reduced Inequalities), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) and 17 (Partnerships for the Goals)."
"(UGEC3213 is double-coded with GDRS3025.) This course examines the gender dimensions of innovation and novelty. The key questions are: How/Why/What/When innovation(s) are gendered? We will discuss the fluidity and messiness of doing and undoing gender in innovation practices and meanings produced. Broadly defined, innovation refers to new ideas, new knowledge, new technologies, new designs, and creative practices with the goal to solve social or technical problems. Many innovations may seem gender-neutral but are inherently imbued with gender perceptions. The course will equip students with ways to apply gender analysis to decipher innovations and innovative processes. The course incorporates sustainable development goals (SDGs) on Gender Equality and Reduced Inequalities to become more discerning toward more sustainable practices to advance Industry Innovation and Infrastructure. Using case studies from the technology culture, the routine practices, and the emergent new economy, students will learn to untangle how gender intersects with the seemingly neutral artefacts of innovation and technology. The course further covers how emergent issues of diversity and inclusion, AI and information technology, social entrepreneurship and social innovation, and leadership style could reshape the existing relationship between gender and innovation to advance sustainability and social resilience."
"(UGEC3214 is double-coded with GDRS3026.) This course examines the rich tradition of feminist film theory and provides students with an understanding of its main concerns and debates. Topics will include the key semiotic and psychoanalytic approaches of the 1970s-1990s, classic films which have inspired feminist debate, avant-garde cinema, local cinema, independent cinema, and postmodern cinema, as well as recent cinematic re-conceptualizations and exploration of gender and sexuality local and abroad. In systems of representation from fine art to mainstream cinema to advertising, women have been constructed and existed as spectacle or passive object “to-be-looked-at,” in Laura Mulvey’s now often quoted words. Following her trail, feminist critics turned their attention to mainstream films and popular media addressed to female spectators and exposed the contradictions within and between the notion of “women’s pictures” and the diversity of female experience. Local cinemas and independent creators also tell their own unique stories of women’s lives in dramatically different cultural contexts. Critics from other fields further complicate these images by examining them through lens including race, class, ability, queerness, and more.Mulvey’s groundbreaking analysis of gendered looking relations in classical Hollywood cinema has since generated numerous analyses of the place of women as spectacle or passive object in films “cut to the measure of [male] desire.” Critics around the world showed how different groups of women attempt to take control of their positioning through viewing or using texts in their own ways, and by creating their own. What happens when female-identified artists, audiences, and theorists look back, and seek to rebel against such cinematic traditions by experimenting with alternative visual languages and narrative tools? This course starts with the paradigm of narrative film analysis that Mulvey outlined in the 1970s and move on to explore a wider range of questions in feminist film studies, including spectatorship, authorship, popular culture, character stereotypes in genre films, self-representation, (g)local cinema, and new feminist media. Students would be introduced to trailblazing works by female filmmakers worldwide, special focus will be placed onto important works in Hong Kong cinema for critical examination and comparative studies. Through critical reflections on notions such as gender stereotypes, representation, power, diversity, and equality, the course engages directly with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 by engaging directly with the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality) and 10 (Reduced Inequalities)."
"(UGEC3224 is double-coded with GDRS3009.)  This course examines issues revolving the family as a social institution in different cultures. It explores processes of how the family is constructed in different forms as it intersects with various social systems including kinship, marriage, class, ethnicity, religion, and political economy. Particular attention is paid to how family as a gendered construction, while being a basic principle of social life globally, exhibits great diversity as it shapes and is shaped by local histories, traditions, and state policies. In an era of globalization and transnational mobility, the ideology and practice of the family are rapidly changing, but there are simultaneously trends of reversion and localization. Students will read ethnographies and develop cross-cultural perspectives on classic and contemporary issues concerning the family, such as work and domesticity, motherhoods and fatherhoods, sexual orientations, reproductive technologies, surrogacy and adoption. Students learn to critically think and articulate about family issues, and will acquire enhanced knowledge and skills in reflexive thinking and positive communication, cultural sensitivity, and diversity and inclusion. The course is relevant to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, in particular SDGs 5 (Gender Equality), 10 (Reduced Inequalities) and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions)."
"(UGEC3225 is double-coded with GDRS3024.)  Educational and occupational accomplishments vary dramatically among individuals and profoundly affect lives. Importantly, gender is among the powerful individual characteristics that affect people's experiences in educational and work settings. Gender shapes youths' experience and outcomes of education across the globe and across history. This course is designed to introduce to students, with a critical mindset, important contemporary issues at the intersection of gender, education and jobs. The topics address the role of gender in school- and related preferences and achievements, with a focus on social and cognitive approaches. For example, what is quality education (SDG goal 4) and why is it important to evaluate it with a gender perspective? Do men and women really differ in their abilities, and if so, by how much? Is personal interest a better explanation of gender imbalances in occupations? What are the ways that biases exist in education and the workplace, and how do teachers, parents, and employers contribute to gender biases (SDG goal 5)? Can gender equality in performance and hiring be improved by removing stereotypes? The literature will cover childhood, adolescence as well as adulthood in order to provide insight into the age-related changes of the gender issues. Particular attention will be paid to issues that relate closely to daily life, both local and international. Empirical evidence will be reviewed to illustrate the gender biases and substantiate the explanatory theories. Potential interventions to address gender biases in education and the workplace will also be discussed."
"(UGEC3227 is double-coded with GDRS3021.)  This course critically explores the development of LGBTQI+ studies as an interdisciplinary field of inquiry. It traces how LGBTQI+ communities develop against the backdrops of social forces and social oppression. It analyzes the cultural, social and legal environments that LGBTQI+ people live with, in diverse spheres such as families, education, employment, health and the media. The discussions focus on both the structural constraints that LGBTQI+ people face, but also the agency and resilience they display. It explores the development of contemporary LGBTQI+ identities and social movements, as well as the politics involved. The course also asks how gender and sexual diversity is understood in different parts of the world in an era of globalization. Students are also exposed to different practices, policies and laws that are related to LGBTQI+ people’s lives.The Sustainable Development Goals vow to work towards a society where no one if left behind, particularly those who are most vulnerable and marginalized. In many parts of the world, LGBTQI+ people are historically amongst the most vulnerable and marginalized in society. This course will discuss the unequal treatment they face in cultural, social, political and legal systems and discuss how such inequality may be addressed."
"(UGEC3228 is double-coded with GDRS3008.)  This course examines the social construction of minorities and the history of Hong Kong public policy towards them, including legal changes, social institutions, immigration policy, and political mobilization. Current debates in public policies such as anti-discrimination legislation, education policies of ethnic minorities, disciplining of youth and anti-poverty scheme will also be evaluated within this context. We will draw on an array of intellectual resources ranging from political economy, critical race theory, feminism, phenomenology and queer theory to examine issues about racial/ethnic minorities, the economically underprivileged, minorities with disabilities, sexual/erotic minorities, gender minorities and youth in light of the latest scholarly discussions on multiculturalism, pluralism and the politics of difference and social recognition.The course is relevant to the Sustainable Development Goals 5 (Gender Equality), 10 (Reduced Inequalities) and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) with a focus on how public policy plays an important role in obstructing and facilitating the attainment of these goals."
"(UGEC3229 is double-coded with GDRS3007.)  This course examines men’s diverse experiences as boys/men and public discourses and practices about masculinities. It will focus on how the gendered social order influences men’s actions and the way men perceive themselves, other men, women, and social situations. It will pay special attention to the exploration of the relationships between multiple dimensions of social relations and inequalities including gender, race/ethnicity, class, and sexual orientation. It will address issues such as: male socialization, boyhood culture, male body images, male friendship, male sexuality and fertility, men’s experiences as fathers, male aggression and violence, men’s commitments to sports and work, and media representations of boys and men in contemporary culture. It will also explore female masculinities and queer masculinities and to what extent they post challenges to hegemonic masculinity. Students will be introduced to the latest developments and their global networks, and to evaluate the prospects for social change in how men may think, feel, and act otherwise.The course resonates with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 by engaging directly with the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality) and 10 (Reduced Inequalities), and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) through critical engagement with different discourses and phenomenon related to masculinities."

"(UGEC3319 is double-coded with FAAS3114.) This course—an interdisciplinary study of art history, archaeology, anthropology, and religious studies—introduces the visual and material culture of the Japanese archipelago from the Prehistoric Age to the twentieth century by surveying major monuments and sites. Major topics include (1) prehistoric potteries, (2) tombs and mortuary furnishings, (3) the influx of Buddhism and its successful development, (4) capitals and provinces, (5) elite culture of the court, aristocrats, and the learned, (6) ceramics and lacquerware, and (7) trans-regional interaction, especially, with China and Korea."
"(UGEC3481 is double-coded with CURE3003.) How do we understand and connect to animal kingdom?How do human-animal connections shape modern culture and society?How do cultural studies and humanities expand our scope on animal and nature?Culture is ordinary, in Raymond William’s saying, but the ordinariness is merely treated as a reflection of human everyday life. Although cultural studies has sustained concern on everyday life with mass production, consumerism, sexism, racism and postmodernism, the discipline always lags behind the concern of nature and animal species. As the issues of animal abuse, environmental protection, factory farming, animal protection policy and law-making, as well as media various portrayals being the hot topics of our (post)modern world, the study of animal with the perspective of cultural studies and other humanity disciplines can explore the possibilities of better human-animal relationship. This course is designed with an empathic concern of other-than-human animals. By exploring different issues of human and animals’ life, this course looks for a harmonious balance of nature and modern culture.This course focuses on three areas, through which we can explore the different aspects of animal and cultural studies. These areas are:A. Entering Jurassic Park – Remaking Animals in Leisure (Lecture A1-A4)B. Attacking Godzilla – Representing Animals in Media (Lecture B1-B4)C. Finding Nemo – Revitalizing Animals in the City  (Lecture C1-C4)Each area covers a set of animal issue discussion. Area A, apart from theorizing animal with cultural studies, tackles the basic animal issues: pet-nurturing, zoo-building, forest-sustaining and tourism. This is to provide a foundation for understanding animals with a critical reflection of everyday life. Area B, set with the concern of media, discusses issues of animal representation in cartoon, cinema, literature and journalism. This is to read how animals would be represented and how this affects human understanding and related policy-making. A screening will be run after Lecture Area B. This is to provide an alternative understanding of animal representation in popular media. Area C further deals with the matters of animal-city relationship in seeing how dogs and cats, cattle and swine, and fishes and dolphins are (mal)treated in the street, the farm and the sea respectively. This is to end the course with a leading thought of perfect balance of nature and modernity; and more queries of human-animal relationship will be raised for contemplation."
"(UGEC3482 is double-coded with CURE3033.) This course is a survey of Southeast Asian cinema read against the backdrop of its distinct historical, political, ecological, and cultural conditions. Initially a Cold War construct comprising Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Cambodia, Brunei, Laos, and Timor-Leste, the term ‘Southeast Asia’ has come to refer to a highly complex and pluralistic region of over 660 million people, 25,000 islands, and 150 ethnolinguistic communities. With its national identities formed from the encounter with and struggle against American, British, French, Dutch, Hispanic, Indian, Japanese, and Chinese influence, Southeast Asia’s movies have served as venues for propaganda and resistance. This course looks at how the remediations of different genres such as noir, melodrama, western, and sci-fi tackle controversial issues of gender, race, religion, poverty, migration, and the environment. Instead of smoothening the continuity of official historical narratives, it uncovers how documentaries, epics, and horror reexamine the trauma of past colonization, authoritarianism, and violence. To conclude, the course explores how television serials, anthology films, and online databases trace nascent cross-border and intra-regional communities beyond the limits of sovereignty."
"(UGEC3483 is double-coded with CURE3034.) This course aims to introduce Korean society and culture through Korean Popular Culture in relation to media and cultural studies scholarship and its socio-cultural contexts. In particular, we will examine the meaning of media and culture and its social changes in contemporary Korea through exploring various emerging trends and cultural studies as methodological tool within modern and contemporary Korean issues. Global popularity of Korean popular culture and the transnational Hallyu (Korean Wave) boom continue to percolate beyond Asia and inspire various critical questions regarding trans-nationalism, cultural imperialism and musical authenticity and hybridity. The course readings engage wide range of various issues and arguments of media and cultural studies scholarship as methodological tools; such as cultural representation, meaning of hegemony, cultural industry/economy and globalism of media, post colonialism, audience of mass media and fandom culture, gender and queer issues, and then further focus on the specific context of Korean popular culture including the pivotal notions of colonial modernity, Japanese imperialism, cultural hegemony in colonial Korea, meaning of Americanization, issues of popular memory and decolonization discourses, nationalism and globalization and Korean Wave, body/gender/sexuality / LGBTQ issue in Korean Media and Popular culture, cyber culture and internet memes, transnationalism and diaspora issues and its aftermath. We actively discuss various audio-visual artifacts including Korean news, music video, films, TV dramas, and pop music in each class in order to understand better the texts and contexts within the historical and sociocultural paradigm of recent sociology, media/communication studies scholarship."
"(UGEC3546 is double-coded with GLSD3405.)  This course aims to elevate students' understanding of Southeast Asia by examining the dynamics of interaction between nation-states, regional organizations, and non-state actors in Southeast Asia under the context of Globalization.
