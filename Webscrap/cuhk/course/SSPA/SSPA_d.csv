"Effective exercise prescriptions are an essential part of improving one's physical fitness and overall health. However, in order to provide an effective exercise program, exercise prescriptions must be individualized and specific to the participant's unique health conditions. As chronic illnesses, such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and lower-back disorder, become increasingly prevalent in modern urban settings, exercise prescriptions for the general population should be modified in order to cater to the specific medical indications of specific populations. Given that a regular exercise training program is recognized as good preventative medicine for chronic diseases, this course is designed to introduce information about specialized exercise prescription to meet the needs of general citizens and people with particular medical conditions. Students will be expected to become familiar with exercise prescriptions for general healthy populations and to use this knowledge to design exercise programs for targeted populations with specific chronic diseases."
"This course includes the principles and theories on fitness training for health and sports performance and the teaching will use an integrated approach. Emphasis will be placed on the understanding of the fitness components, training and its teaching with the up-to-date science and technologies. In addition, the learning regimes together with the planning and implementation of the appropriate fitness programmes."
"The implementation of digital solutions in physical education embraces the basic fundamentals present in various aspects of modern education reform. This undertaking entails using technology to empower students and restructuring the learning process to enhance student engagement. Wearable technology, such as bracelets, adds a visual element to physical activities, thereby providing students with a digital representation of their activity levels. Furthermore, access to online resources enables physical educators to substantially expand what constitutes physical education. Numerous online instructional materials are available for different types of sports and physical activities that can be implemented in class, thereby providing students with a break from the norm. However, digital solutions go beyond merely enhancing the levels of student engagement and altering the curriculum by facilitating the extension of the educators’ influence outside the gymnasium and into the classroom. This course aims to explore and conduct experiment on the benefits and limitations of using technology as a pedagogical tool to conduct sports classes and physical activity sessions in contemporary society."
