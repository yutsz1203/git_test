"Independent study gives students added flexibility to design study programmes suited to a particular area of interest or to delve more deeply into a specific topic. Students need to find a faculty member willing to serve as their supervisor, and together, devise a format. There are a wide range of possibilities under independent study. The more common alternatives are: (a) Selection of a topic not normally covered in our curriculum in which the student has an interest. Normally the student would prepare a literature review on the selected topic. It would then be common for the student to perform some application or extension of this body of knowledge by extending or substantiating that knowledge by some data collection. (b) Preparation of a case and accompanying teacher's note. The case must be based on real organisations and substantial data collection would be expected. The student would be expected to demonstrate application of theory in preparation of the teacher's note."

"Family business is a puzzling topic that fascinates academics, investors, and managers. These businesses are ridiculed, especially in Hong Kong, as unprofessional and cronyism-driven. But one cannot ignore their importance: families started many of the most successful firms in the world; families owned the majority of listed firms; many family firms uphold the best innovation, quality and brand value; and family funds constitute some largest philanthropic and investment projects. This course takes a family enterprising approach to discuss the importance, diversity, complexity, and more importantly continuous entrepreneurship of business family (as opposed to family business). Apart from lectures and case analysis, students should interact with family members and associated professionals to understand the types, life cycle, conflict, succession, characteristics of business families.

Students will be placed into groups and each group will be asked to practice specific consulting skills and roles, with opportunities for each student to plan a consulting engagement, facilitate discussions with clients, and lead a consulting team."
"Making decision is a fundamental life skill. According to multiple sources, an adult makes about 35,000 decisions every single day. Some decisions are ‘no-brainers.’ Most decisions you’ll face are tough and complex with no easy or obvious solutions. Such decisions affect you, your family, friends, colleagues, work teams, organizations and many other known and unknown. An effective decision-making process may be more complicated than flipping a coin, tossing a dart or letting someone else to make a mediocre choice which depends on luck for success. To understand the complexity and irrationality that arise in human decision making, you are going to answer many interesting questions in this course. Answers to these questions will shed light on your decision-making process and outcomes. Throughout the course journey of lectures, business cases and interactive exercises, you’ll scratch your heads and learn how to critically make life and work decisions with evidence and effective process."

"Both organizations and society are becoming increasingly global as developments in technology, media, and politics have made the world “smaller” and increasingly interdependent. While in the past the international arena has been limited to large multinational corporations and even some large companies have only been active in their local market, today increasingly many companies, both small and large, engage in business which transcends geographic, political, and cultural boundaries. Thus, for most firms international business is no longer an option it is a must.Differences between countries such as cultural differences and institutional differences have important implications for the optimal way to conduct business in a country. Although the world is becoming more global, today more than ever people have an expectation that foreigners doing business in their country have an understanding of what management practices are normally used locally, and organizational behavior is still strongly influenced by people’s cultural background. To be successful in this global economy, a manager must understand the effect diverse cultures have on how organizations work and be capable of managing multiple cultures interacting—two skills this course will seek to develop. The course is highly interactive using case studies and simulations as well as interactive lectures and discussions to facilitate learning. This course will help prepare people planning to work in large and small firms alike to be senior executives making important international business decisions and acting as an effective international manager. Most managers agree that international business is not easy. Thus, we will learn strategies to make the internationalization process easier, and we will develop an understanding of the different modes of entry which are at our disposal and when different modes are preferable. This course will also study mergers and acquisitions which are becoming increasingly important in our world today. The course will explore key strategies for international business and also investigate how to interact with people from different countries most effectively, how to work on multicultural teams effectively, how to be an effective leader in different countries, and how to conduct international negotiations. We will also study how to deal with complexity and deal with multiple tasks at the same time which is an important challenge that international managers face. The course will also explore key design, management, and strategy issues multinational companies face. While this course will focus on international business broadly, for part of the course we will take a deep dive into how to do business in mainland China as an example of international business. Thus, we will explore how to effectively enter and operate in China, how to negotiate effectively with Chinese, which strategies and management practices work best in China, how to be effective leader in China, etc."
"It’s an era of “Technology Everywhere”. The rapid advancement in technology literally impacts every sector of our society. From taxi services to mobile payment, from robotic engineering to artificial intelligence; new innovations and technology have laid substantial or even subversive changes to our ways of doing business.

"The aim of this course is to provide a solid grounding for students interested in top management and (to a lesser extent) government policy issues concerning the innovation process within organizations. The course is divided into several main parts. The first part discusses technology at the macro level: its impact on industries and nations, and patterns of technological change. The second part focuses on disruptive innovations – what they are, how they affect firms and industry change, and how they facilitate entrepreneurship. The third part deals with the response of firms to disruptive innovations, including the changing basis of competition in markets. The increasing returns environment is also examined. The fourth part focuses on building the internal capabilities of organizations to innovate, and discusses the innovator's solution. The fifth part discusses additional topics in innovation such as entrepreneurship and spurring innovation at the societal level. Case studies, both written and video-based, are used extensively to illustrate a range of technologies and the problems associated with developing them and bringing them to market. The course spends much time examining new technologies, how to think strategically about them, how to develop them and how firms should pursue them (or why they fail to pursue these new technologies)."
