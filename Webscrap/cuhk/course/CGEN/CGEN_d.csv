"By the time of this course, students should have acquired basic knowledge in multiple aspects that affect overall wellbeing of an elder / support of an elder and or his care-givers. This course aims to enable students to translate the acquired knowledge to real life practice, and to evaluate their own work / services for improvement. Students should have hands-on approach to care of the elderly that range from healthy ageing to end of life care or events. In this case study, students are required to write up on a case in which they have actively participated in promoting healthy ageing of the senior citizens, and reflections on what they have learnt and areas for improvement."

Students should have hands-on approach to care of the elderly that range from healthy ageing to end of life care or events. In this Case Studies II, students are required to write up on a case who has chronic disabilities that may require community support (service models). Students are expected to write on the care needs of the elderly (and/or their informal caregivers), what have been offered to support the elderly to “Ageing in Place”. Students are also expected to give comments on possible limitations of current services and suggest areas for service improvement to meet the needs."

Students should have hands-on approach to care of the elderly that range from healthy ageing to end of life care or events. In this Case Studies III, students are required to write up on a case of the elderly who has multiple chronic illness and disabilities, and cannot manage independent community living by himself. Students are expected to identify problems of the elderly through a multi-dimensional approach, formulation on what/why have happened, and the special care needs of the elderly. The Case Studies should also include personal reflection on what they have learnt from the case and possible areas for improvement if they come across similar case in the future."

Students should have hands-on approach to care of the elderly that range from healthy ageing to end of life care or events. In this Case Studies IV, students are required to write up on a case of the elderly who either has severe cognitive impairment or at his very late life / end of life. Students are expected to identify major areas of concerns either from the elder or his immediate care-givers, and to discuss on potential care plan that facilitate “good quality of dying”. The Case Studies should also include personal reflection on what they have learnt from the case and possible areas for improvement if they come across similar case in the future."
"By the end of the one (full time) or two year (part time) period, students are required to submit a Project / Practicum Report that demonstrate their ability to translate knowledge to practice, and ability to evaluate the work scientifically. This will be through stages from Project (or Practicum) Report I to Project (or Practicum) Report III. A project can take the form of a research or a continuous quality improvement program with service evaluation. At this Project Report I (stage one), students are expected to identify a theme of interests, to conduct preliminary literature search and identify gaps in the area to justify the need of such a project. Towards the end of the course, students are required to submit a report on the above work, and give specific objectives / questions in which they are to embark on for the stage two and stage three work."

A practicum can take the form of a participatory research or a continuous quality improvement with active (instead of passive) participation and feedback from participants. Students choosing practicum is expected to work at equivalent hours as those opt for Project Reports. At this Practicum Report I (stage one), students are expected to identify an area of interests, current services provision, its gaps and needs to close the gap. Towards the end of the course, students are required to submit a report on the above work, and give specific areas of service improvement in which they are to embark on for the stage two and stage three work."

At this Practicum Report II (stage two), they are required to answer the practical logistics (e.g. teaming up, training material, methods/tools for process and client outcome evaluation, time-table) in the service initiation. They may also have fine tuned to the actual service running. Towards the end of the module, students are required to submit a report on a final protocol for field work."
