The course also includes a practical aspect of drafting and developing institutional policy as part of the studies in cultural management."
"Archaeology reveals many interesting findings about ancient social lives. Food has always been an essential category in human culture. The amount of food surplus determines the strength and social bonding of a society; and rituals are usually revolved around food preparation, presentation, and distribution. In China, a large number of archaeological sites contained remains of food, and occasionally drink. This course picks the representative sites to illustrate what food meant to a society that can be summarized in categories listed below: 1. Consumption of staple food: rice and noodles; 2. Perception of tastes: sweetness and bitterness; 3. Cooking methods: steaming and roasting; 4. Exotic food: what had been imported to China and when? 5. Drinks: tea and wine; 6. Rituals that involved food. This course is suitable for students who have interests in Archaeology but may not have prior knowledge about it. It aims to prepare them for exploring the past of China in the future, either in form of class teaching or self-learning, or both. The course gets students to apply the designs and innovations of ancient China in regards to food and the practice of cooking, dining and rituals to the present."

It intends to help students to build a solid technical as well as intellectual base for further specialized studies in cultural management."
"The course examines the correlation between art and institutions in twentieth-century China, aiming to encourage students to think about modern Chinese art through the concept of the artworld. The downfall of the Qing dynasty and the establishment of the Republican China transformed the social and institutional organisation of the production, distribution, and consumption of art as well as the traditional patronage system in modern China. The structural changes conditioned the emergence of formal and informal art institutions that facilitated yet constrained artistic practices, laying the foundation for the development of a modern art world in China. The course looks at the history of modern Chinese art and the formation of different art institutions in the sociocultural and economic context of modern China. Weekly topics are structured chronologically and thematically, which cover a wide range of themes, including art schools, art societies, museums, exhibitions, and art market. Adopting an interdisciplinary approach, the course offers students multi-perspectives to understand the transformation of modern Chinese art and the interactions between artistic practices and society in modern China."
"(UGED2285 is double-coded with CUMT2004.) This is a cross-disciplinary course straddles the studies of history, anthropology, and sociology from the perspective of material objects. The course intends to achieve two goals: first, it leads students to identify and appreciate the traditional Chinese values, which include the teachings of Confucianism and Daoism, embodied in the many production types pertinent to what we now regard as Chinese; and second, it explains how those various material types ended up being included and translated as the representative categories of Chinese civilization throughout the historical times. The course will begin from the basic by introducing the mainstream material productions from ancient to modern China: jades, antique bronzes, lacquer, ceramics, architecture, silk, as well as grave goods. The discussions instruct students to appreciate these essential elements of Chinese culture from the perspectives of their physical qualities, craftsmanship, and historical values. They are also to encourage students to think about the roles of material objects in shaping cultural, ethnic, and even national identities."

"(UGED2286 is double-coded with CUMT2006.) The exhibition has become a site of knowledge production and a prominent and diverse part of contemporary culture. Regarding “Chinese art” as a social constructed concept, the course uses “exhibition” as an entry point to engage with issues concerning Chinese art and to explore the role played by exhibitions in the formation of the knowledge of Chinese art. It introduces the current theories and debates on the theory and history of exhibition, and the display methods, examining the changing concept of Chinese art and curatorial practices through detailed analysis of case studies. The first part of the course traces the formation of the concept of “Chinese art” by looking closely at the history of exhibitions on Chinese objects from the late Qing dynasty to the early twentieth century. The second part examines important exhibitions that have shaped our understanding of Chinese art. Structured thematically, the course discusses the curatorial concepts of selective significant international exhibitions on Chinese art, and investigate how scholarly research has been transformed into exhibitions which have shaped our understanding of Chinese art, constructed identity and been deployed for political ends."
"“Curating,” a word that was once only used in museums, now has applications in everything in our lives, ranging from radio station DJs to almost all types of social media content. The popularity of the word reflects the growing importance of assembling, managing and presenting data and collection, a process of gathering information that brings maximum value relevant to different audiences.In this context, this course is designed to provide students with an opportunity to learn about both historical and contemporary examples of how culture is understood through exhibition design and curating. By covering various forms of curatorial traditions, disruptive ideas, and emergent digital practices in the ever-expanding field of curation, this course equips students with the ability to question what they take for granted and reflect on existing issues conducive to different cultures, values and beliefs. By the end of the course, students will be able to critically examine how knowledge is created inside and outside of art institutions and how curation could potentially become public knowledge."
"The artworld is constructed through a network of individuals and institutions, all of which participate in con-tributing to the wider ecosystem of the global network and marketplace for art. The co-generative or mutu-ally constitutive nature between key players and institutions provides the context and rules for evaluating the aesthetic and economic value of art objects. In recent years, the art market has witnessed tremendous growth, and clusters of new galleries, global art fairs and auction houses have sprung up in cities within both developed and emerging economies, forming an ever-expanding network of art transitions, exhibi-tions, and causing an explosion of cultural activities amid various forms of urbanization. This course aims to provide students with theoretical knowledge and practical skills on how to identify the dynamic roles and activities of key players and institutions in the art market. It begins with an introduction to the history of art market, patronage system and art market logic. The, various practical skills are covered, including art valuation methods, techniques of buying and selling art, and agreements and laws that govern art transactions.

"This course leads students to study various modes and philosophies of visual arts management undertaken in different venues. Aesthetics and art criticisms are critical in directing art interpretation and presentation. Contemporary management of visual arts responds predominantly to the worldwide discussions on modernism as well as various post-modernist writings. In addition, it has to operate in accordance with the prescribed state policy. For this bilateral concern of art management, the course comprises two sections. The first section leads students to study the writings on aesthetics by critics from Plato to Foucault, whose arguments are still valid in inspiring many art exhibitions. The second section discusses the practical concerns and techniques in maximizing the social and economic impacts of art exhibitions and relevant events. Both sections discuss case studies taken from different parts of the world."
"This course discusses the missions, administrations, and strategies of performing art organizations. Since the 1950s, performing art managers have realized the significance of efficient management in achieving popularity and sale. This course will go through the general topics as to how the performing art organizations are administered in national and legal terms; how they solicit funding; how they are operated in terms of ticketing and touring; and how they are strategically promoted for both branding and social benefits."
"This course introduces a new genre in the art discipline that employs electronic and digital devices as the main medium of communication. The course contains three sessions. The first session explains the birth of this set of contemporary art practices in relation to the Dadaist movement of the early twentieth century that opened up new concepts for visual arts. This will be followed by a session that discusses the range of media now commonly adopted in the discipline, including video, photography, computer graphics, webpage, and the Internet. Different set of techniques are involved in these productions, and they often generate quite different social impacts that affect both the producers and the users. Students are instructed to understand both the technological and social aspects of these areas. The last session comprises a series of workshops that lead students to appreciate and comment on the most featured productions. Emphasis is placed on the angle to promote this new art type as a rising cultural sector in the society."
"Public art is considered as an important cultural asset of metropolitan cities, closely related to city images and development. Community art serves as a tool for community development, based on the understanding that expression, mastery and communication through the arts powerfully encode cultural values, thus bringing deeper meanings of experience, participation and involvement, sense of belonging to the general public and the community. This course aims to advance students’ understanding of public and community arts by embedding them in the theoretical discussions and critiques of cities and public spaces and practical experiences. It also imparts the knowledge and skills about managing public arts and actualizing community art programs, and discusses the way to support their development responding to the needs."
"“Curator” once referred to an expert in keeping collections and making exhibitions, but has been expanded to encompass a hybrid role in innovation and knowledge creation. Today, curators are active agents in social and cultural transformation, taking part in dynamic projects presented by museums, commercial galleries, non-profit art spaces, biennials, art fairs, and many disruptive platforms beyond the field of art that didn’t previously exist. Curators produce knowledge, engage their audience, spark innovation, and constantly challenge the role of “curator” beyond the confines of the status quo across varied institutional settings. This course aims to provide students with hands-on experience in exhibition curation and engages students in a broad spectrum of real-world experiences and professional networking opportunities, aiming to prepare students for future curatorial projects/jobs. It covers topics such as idea conceptualization, proposal writing, pitching, budgeting, contracting, publication, exhibition design, installation and exhibition maintenance. By co-curating an exhibition in a non-profit art space in Hong Kong, students will take part in the various stages of exhibition making. With a focus on exhibition experience, audience engagement, and sociability, this course will train students in the role of being a curator and enable students to develop leadership skills and critically apply knowledge conducive to creative outcomes."
"The concept of “creative industry” was proposed by the Labor Party in the U.K. in 1997. It refers to the activities that are embedded in individuals’ creativities, talents and skills, which have the potential for employment opportunities and economic growth through the exploitation of intellectual properties. Creative industry has become a key area in contemporary cultural policies. This course introduces students to the basic knowledge of managing entrepreneurship, which is a key issue in the creative industries. It comprises three parts. The first part provides a general introduction. The second part discusses the nature of entrepreneurship in creative industries and demonstrates the entrepreneurial process, through which, creative ideas are generated, cultural diffusion is stimulated and innovation processes are carried out.

"From the perspective of archaeology, this course is tailored to cross disciplinary boundaries between heritage and contemporary issues. The world of ancient China is a rich source of inspirations for museum work; tourism; films and documentary; literature; designs; and even commercial productions. Yet misinterpretations over Chinese history have led to problematic descriptions of heritage and archaeological sites. Indeed, there have not been many discussions of Chinese historical past independent of texts, and this course intends to fill up the lacuna. Taking ancient and medieval China as subjects, this course leads student to appreciate Chinese arts and archaeological finds from between the Neolithic and the 13th century. The course urges students to develop acute senses in reading and writing about heritage for contemporary needs."
"Museums have multiple roles in a society. They are academic institutes and public arenas for education. In the broad term, they represent national culture and communal heritage. This course leads students to understand museum exhibitions and management within social contexts. The lectures respond to the following issues:1. What are the functions and achievements of museum activities?2. In what ways can we understand and learn from an exhibition? What are the essential elements of museum catalogues and cultural writing?3. How do museum workers balance both marketing and social needs?4. In what ways can we participate in the operation of a museum?The course draws discussions from both the perspectives of museum workers and visitors. Some current issues concerning the roles of museums are also covered."
"This course is continuation of CUMT1001, Introduction to Cultural Management, and looks at cultural management from the macro perspective. Successful culture managers work to maintain healthy balance between culture and its relevant fields of interests, which sometimes could turn harmful or beneficial to the growth and development of the corresponding cultural area. The first session discusses the mutual dependence between culture and various areas, which include laws, economy, community, national interests, and art practitioners. In practice, cultural managers usually have to conform to the values and ethnics of the corresponding countries. For that reason, the second session will look at the approach taken in a few remarkable examples, which Taiwan, China, Singapore, South Korea, U.K., and the U.S."
"This course aims to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the culture-led city development phenomenon and equip them with the protocols for execution and practice. It comprises three blocks: Block 1 unfolds an overall picture of the phenomenon, introduces the related concepts, displays the disciplinary foundation of this topic, traces its history, and discusses the rationales and developing tendency. Block 2 studies the urban sociological and economic approaches employed in developing the theoretical foundation, highlighting a transition in capitalist production mode and urban governance upheld by public-private partnership modes. Criticisms are also presented to complete a dialectic mindset of this phenomenon. With a strong practical dimension, Block 3 teaches students various methods to make consultancy and policy recommendations for culture-led urban development projects. A variety of practices that constitute the culture-led strategy are discussed, such as how to plan for a creative city and cultural facilities, how to boost creative industries and develop cultural quarters and creative clusters, as well as how to revitalize historic quarters."
"Archaeology is an intriguing topic. In CUMT3009 Interpreting Chinese Antiquities, students are taught the essential contents and arguments in each Chinese archaeological period. At this advanced level, students are led to analyze the presentation of Chinese archaeological materials in different modern forms, which are namely, movies, novels, documentary films, museum displays, auction houses, and antique shops. Each class picks up a representative topic and a form of modern expression for discussions. Students of this course are required to have knowledge in Chinese archaeology, because the discussions are carried out in seminar forms, in which their inputs are required. The course gets students to apply the designs and innovations of ancient China to areas, which they may find interests that will eventually get in touch with the wide public."
"The course studies the history, theories and techniques of organizing cultural activities for social and political causes. It investigates the relationship between cultural expressions and the infrastructure of power, and the application of arts and culture for social, political actions, covering such major movements from the avant-garde of the 19th Century, the USSR and the Chinese propaganda movements, to the arts for civil right movements since 1960s. Case studies of similar movements in Hong Kong will also be included. The final part of the course will introduce to students the operational and managerial skill required for organizing such cultural activities."
"This course picks up topics, which cannot be fully covered in CUMT4007 Museum Studies, but are essential for students pursuing careers in the area of museum and exhibition planning. This course is an advanced version, because it will touch on debated issues regarding museums. It focuses on installation, display, and site management. The purposes of the course may be summarized as follows: 1. What are the various display methods in museums? What are the concerns involved in selecting the ‘right’ ones? 2. How are museum workers (non-curatorial) trained? 3. What are the essential facilities a museum is expected to have? Why? 4. What is the role of museum in the contemporary arts, which is the area of debate regarding its significance and curatorship?
