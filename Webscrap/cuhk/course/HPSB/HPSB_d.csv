"The United Nation Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2015-30 30 were adopted to strive for a world that is ‘just, equitable and inclusive’. Those priority risk behaviours causing global burden of diseases are often established early in life and research findings have also confirmed the existence of common determinants (e.g., pathways in the brain) and the inter-relationships between the determinants of risk behaviours and behaviours themselves."

Improvement of behaviours and well-being of citizens would not naturally occur without a specific “intentional intervention”. The concept of Healthy Setting is to cultivate a healthy physical/psycho-social environment in the setting where people spend most of the time for working, studying, enjoyment of life, or for specific purposes. It is a very effective “intentional intervention” in achieving improvements in both health and well-being of citizens as it would penetrate into the wide arrays of their daily experiences. The whole concept of healthy setting is also based on striving the principles of ‘just, equitable and inclusive’ for citizen development. The key to successful implementation is engagement of key stakeholders in strategic way."
"This course aims to integrate health promotion with the creation and development of health messages. The Course will cover the theories related to interpersonal and public health communications, principles and techniques for designing and disseminating effective health messages, plus class activities facilitating applications of the knowledge in real-life health settings.(pre-requisite: HSPB5001 or HSOC5001)"
