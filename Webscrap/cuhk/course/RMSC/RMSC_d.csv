"This course introduces the general methodology for credit risk management – how should we handle the possibility our counterparty may not pay us what they owe? Answering this question depends on who the counterparty is and the nature of our contract with them. As such, in this course we explore credit risk models for retail customers, credit risk measures for portfolios, credit mitigation techniques for markets, credit derivatives used by traders and much else besides, all in the context of the latest Basel regulations and the lessons learned from Credit Crisis of 2007-8."

"This course aims at understanding the application of derivatives theories for the practical risk management. It starts by reviewing basic concepts of pricing and hedging derivatives, like risk-neutral valuation, arbitrage strategies, hedging strategies, implied volatilities and the Greeks. The Value-at-Risk framework for derivatives positions is discussed. Student will also learn how to apply option theoretic approach to credit risk management. Specifically, the capital structure model will be applied to measure the default probability. The Moody's KMV methodology and CreditRisk+ are introduced. Advisory: For Risk Management Science, Quantitative Finance and Risk Management Science, Statistics majors only."
"This course provides students with the opportunity to apply their knowledge to solve real-world problems. Students are required to complete a group project, give a final project presentation and submit a written report, on which their assessment is based. Advisory: For majors only."
"In this course, students are required to review selected readings in academic journal in Statistics and Risk Management. Students are required to form a group to complete a project, in which the latest techniques of Risk Analytics are applied to tackle a real-world problem. They are also required to submit an interim and final written report, on which their assessment will be based. Advisory: For majors only."
"The course serves to provide a bridge between the classroom and the real business world. Students will be required to complete a group project assigned by a company or an organization on a part-time basis. A team of three to five students will undertake a project under the joint supervision of an instructor and a member of the company or organization. Students will be required to give a final project presentation and submit a written report, on which their assessment will be based. Advisory: For majors only."
"Students will join practicum in a financial-technology themed or start-up themed company on a full-time or part-time basis. Students are required to complete assignments about risk analytics jointly issued by the course instructor and a member of the company. They are also required to submit an interim and final written report, on which their assessment will be based. Advisory: For majors only."
"This course discusses modern applications of advanced statistical methods in finance. Methods include Monte Carlo simulation, EWMA and GARCH model for estimating volatilities and correlations, calculation of Value at Risk using different approaches, data mining methods including Principal component analysis, Logistic regression, Multinomial logit, Linear Discriminant analysis, Classification Tree and Artificial Neural Network."
"This course provides students with fundamental concepts of risk and risk management. It further introduces risk management tools used in financial products. Topics include market risk, credit risk and integrated risk management."
"Risk measurement and quantification are the fundamentals of risk management procedures. This course discusses various types of risk measures but mainly focuses on the methodologies of calculating Value-at-Risk (VaR) such as historical simulation, parametric VaR, delta-gamma approximation and Monte-Carlo simulation. The uses of VaR in risk management are also addressed. Topics include portfolio risk management, asset allocation and measuring the performance of portfolio managers."

"Fixed income securities are highly sensitive to the fluctuation of interest rates. Thus interest rate modelling becomes crucial for pricing and managing fixed income securities. This course introduces various types of fixed income securities and interest rate models. It covers the celebrated Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) model as well as some term-structure models including Ho-Lee, Hull-White and the CIR models."
"The Credit Crisis of 2007 devastated the global financial industry and demonstrated that, despite unprecedented financial sophistication, proper credit risk management is vital for the good health of any financial institution. In this course, we will cover the cat-and-mouse history of regulation of credit, taking us to the present day. Along the way, we cover various attempts at modeling and quantifying credit risk, which will lead us through topics like VaR, copulas, credit derivatives, different credit risk methodologies (e.g. Credit Risk Plus, CreditMetrics) and much else besides. We will also discuss various case histories of financial institutions failing due to poor credit risk management."
