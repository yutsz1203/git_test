"As the first in a series of language courses, this course invites students without prior knowledge of Arabic to explore the basic features of Modern Standard Arabic. Supported by audiovisual aids, students will receive intensive practice in spoken and written Arabic through interactive class work, homework and online exercises. They will become familiar with the basic concepts of Arabic grammar and learn how to interact in some simple everyday situations."
"Building on the knowledge acquired in ARAB1000, this course aims to further develop students’ ability to communicate in Arabic in various everyday situations. It also seeks to give students a taste of Arabic culture and invites them to explore cultural differences. Through intensive practice students will develop more confidence in interacting in Arabic while further expanding and solidifying their understanding of the basic grammar and pronunciation patterns."
"This course aims to further enhance students’ communication skills in the four language domains listening, speaking, reading and writing. Students are expected to communicate confidently in a wider range of social interactions including more formal situations and simple professional contexts as well as reporting past events and sharing experience. At the end of this course, students will have completed a proficiency level comparable to level A1 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR)."
"This is a summer intensive Arabic language course for beginners, covering the full syllabus of ARAB1000 and 2000."
