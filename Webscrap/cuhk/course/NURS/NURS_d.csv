This protocol will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the nursing innovation developed in NURS 8112 at individual, organizational and/ or community levels. The students are required to obtain ethical approval for conducting scientific evaluation of the nursing innovation."
"This course is offered in Term 2 of Year 3 to provide students with individual evidence-based practice research supervision in client sampling, implementation of nursing innovation, process monitoring, and data collection. The students are provided with opportunities to critically integrate their knowledge into clinical and translational research, clinical leadership and decision making, as well as advanced nursing practice to facilitate successful implementation of the nursing innovation. This course enables students to consolidate the knowledge that they have learnt in the previous study years and translate such knowledge to real practice."
"This course is offered in Term 1 of Year 4 to pair up with NURS8104 as a year-long course. The course provides students with individual evidence-based practice research supervision in the process of analysing the data collected for evaluating the nursing innovation and reviewing the process of its implementation. The students are provided with opportunities to interpret the study findings, critically discuss the implications of the findings on advanced nursing practice, nursing professional development and nursing science advancement. The course also enables students to discuss a systematic plan on how to translate the developed evidence to immediate nursing practice."
"This 5-unit course is offered in Term 2 of Year 4 to pair up with NURS8103 as a year-long course. The course provides students with individual evidence-based practice research supervision in the process of analysing the data collected for evaluating the nursing innovation and reviewing the process of its implementation. The students are provided with opportunities to critically discuss the implications of the evaluative findings on advanced nursing practice, nursing professional development and nursing science advancement. The course also enables the students to discuss a systematic plan on how to translate the developed evidence to immediate nursing practice. By the end of this course, the students are required to integrate theoretical and clinical knowledge in their empirical research study and submitting a thesis for assessment prior to graduation."
"This course is offered in Term 1 of Year 2 and Year 3 to provide students with interactive workshops and tutorials to strengthen their knowledge on research methodology, facilitating them to critically apply such knowledge to their research project in a nursing specialty."
"This course covers the foundational principles of evidence-based practice and the critical scientific appraisal of evidence to guide advanced evidence-based reasoning and decision making for translation and application to practice. Students are expected to summarise the evidence to address the identified practice issue and to guide development of their project management plan. In this course, each student is required to regularly meet with his/her supervisor who will provide necessary guidance and supervision in thesis writing and monitor the student’s academic progress."
