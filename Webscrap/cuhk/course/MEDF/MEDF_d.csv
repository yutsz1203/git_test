"This course introduces students to the foundation knowledge of biochemistry and molecular biology, including cellular processes and molecular aspects of cells and tissues in the human body, before they embark on the journey of Health Sciences II to get an overview of the human physiological functions. Topics in this course range from introducing the ingredients of life and biomolecules, mechanisms of membrane transport and cellular transport, cellular events leading to energy production, cell cycle and its regulation, overview of cell signaling and its relationship with neurotransmission and drug responses, to basic blood components and the biology of blood cells. Selected topics would be supplemented by case studies to review the relevance of these concepts to medical conditions or their applications."
"The human body can be studied through its levels of organization, with each level representing different features of life. In particular, the cellular and molecular levels enable us to appreciate how excitable cells such as neurons communicate within the human body by utilizing electrical voltages created by the movement of electrolytes across cell membranes. The generation of these micro-voltages is an important functional basis of various organ systems, such as the nervous system and the cardiovascular system. In physiology, one of the primary ions of electrolytes is the sodium ion, which plays essential roles in determining plasma osmolality, water balance and even blood pressure. In this foundation course, students will learn various aspects of basic science and organ-specific human physiology essential for an understanding of how the human body functions. Students are exposed to important concepts from both the chemical and physical sciences, which they then relate to human cell and organ functions."
"This is an integrated course covering the structural, physiological and molecular aspects of cells and tissues in the human body. It provides a solid foundation upon which students can embark onto the full-fledged Medical, Nursing, Pharmacy, Chinese Medicine and Biotechnology, Entrepreneurship and Healthcare Management curriculum."
"This course will introduce undergraduate students to healthcare issues and challenges facing our society in the 21st century. The study of public health and healthcare ethics related themes will include history of modern medicine and public health, current global health issues, professionalism and various approaches to ethical reasoning that enable students to address the moral concerns related to public health and healthcare challenges. The various academic disciplines within the domains of public health will be introduced through case presentations of various global public health issues including COVID-19, SARS, air pollution, healthcare safety, health equity, health demography, obesity and non-communicable diseases followed by experience sharing by eminent health professionals."
Course overview:To understand the basic theories of communication and appreciate the importance of effective communication.
"Students will learn about interprofessional collaboration and team working in the health care setting and gain understanding of the roles and responsibilities of medical and allied professionals in health care. Students will interview patients from The Alliance of Patients’ Mutual Help Organisation (APMHO) and understand chronic health problems, patient experience of hospital and community care and professionalism. Students from different disciplines are required to work collaboratively in group to complete a reflective digital assignment. They would be divided into groups and arranged to interview health care service user, including individual(s) with chronic health problem or family carers, to share their experiences related to interactions with health professionals in various situations. The group will then have to capture either their positive and/or negative experiences, and present it through the means of digital storytelling (a short video clip that combines multimedia, including images, sound, text or video)."
"This course will introduce undergraduate students to healthcare issues and challenges facing our society in the 21st century. The study of public health will include history of modern medicine and public health to current global health issues including infectious disease & pandemics, non-communicable diseases, air pollution and policy making. Introduction to data, research and evidence base will encompass data interpretations and study designs, bias and misinformation to equip students with the basics in finding and critically analysing information and in presenting information in public health topic and oral presentation"
