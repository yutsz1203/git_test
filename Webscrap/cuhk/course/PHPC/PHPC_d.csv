"This field study course is supplementary to the three classroom-based courses CHPR2001, PHPC2009 and PHPC3016 on the environmental factors in public health. Students can gain first-hand experiences and grasp certain practical skills by conducting the field studies in Hong Kong, China and other areas. Environmental health is about how the environmental factors may adversely impact the public health and what we can do to prevent or minimize these impacts. By the scale, the hazards can be local (e.g., industrial and household pollution, traffic exhaust), regional (e.g., deteriorating regional air quality), or global (e.g., climate change); by the relationship to social development, the hazards can be traditional (e.g., household hygiene) or modern (e.g., new chemicals). Without field studies, the students may have difficulties in understand the broad scopes of environmental health practice. This course is to fill in this gap by conducting local and regional field studies and equipping the students with practical skills (e.g., air sampling techniques) in environmental monitoring, risk assessment and management. Students are first required to select a study topic of interest, for example air pollution and respiratory diseases, water pollution and metal industry, and social development and sustainability, and then to review literature, to collect information from the places visited, and to write up a final report.This course will be held during term breaks under the supervision of one or more faculty members. Students are responsible for all travel expenses in the field study, including transportation, food, accommodation, and travel insurance.The objectives of the course are three-fold: (1) to offer students a field-based education early in their undergraduate programs for the extension of classroom learning through direct observation and experience; (2) to deepen students’ understanding on relationships between environment and health, with emphasis on pollution, social development, and sustainability; and (3) to provide students a comprehensive view on local and regional public health issues."

"This course introduces students to major perspectives, theories, and methods in the field of sociology of health and medicine. We consider a variety of social, political, economic, and cultural factors to understand the topics of health, illness, and medicine instead of simply looking at the biological phenomena and medical knowledge. We will explore questions such as: What are the social meanings of illness? What is social production of health and illness? How do social ties and social capital affect health? How does the social environment interact with genes to influence health? What is medicalization and what are possible consequences of medicalization? How should health care systems be organized?
