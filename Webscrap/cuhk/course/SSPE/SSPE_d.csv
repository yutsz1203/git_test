"The purpose of this course is to allow students in the Masters’ degree programme to pursue advanced guided individual study in selected areas of sports science and physical education. It provides an opportunity for students to review the literature of their fields of specialization and to prepare for the writing of their project proposals. Examples are topics within the areas of biomechanics, exercise physiology, sports management, sports psychology, etc. A student is expected to read according to a reading list prescribed or approved by the supervisors and to confer regularly and frequently with the supervisor. Assessment is based on the completion of reading and course requirements."
"Students with the agreement and guidance of their supervisors, may elect to conduct a small research project on a significant problem in one of the following areas: 1) management of physical education, sport and recreation; 2) exercise physiology; 3) biomechanics; 4) sports psychology; 5) sport sociology; and 6) others (with the permission of the supervisor). In general the project may employ either quantitative or qualitative methods, such as experimental study, survey, action research or case study. (Students who have obtained an overall GPA of 3.0 or above are eligible to take the course.)"
