"This is a project-based course in which students will be grouped into different teams. Members of each group shall come from different disciplines in at least two different faculties and comprised of both international and local students as far as possible. Each member of the research group should approach the topic from their own discipline and a comparative analysis should be made of varying Chinese and Western perspectives. By doing so, each student will gain an all-round knowledge and diverse perspective of the topic."
