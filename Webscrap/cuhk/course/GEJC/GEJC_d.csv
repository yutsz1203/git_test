"From a colony of the British Empire to the SAR of the PRC, the Hong Kong story has undergone many ups and downs, twists and turns. Designed from a sociological perspective, but specifically for students without sociological background or much background knowledge about Hong Kong, this course shall guide them through the journey of Hong Kong and its people so far. It will pick up popular images about Hong Kong, such as ""a laissez-faire economic miracle"", ""the safest place in the world"", or ""the land of opportunity"", evaluating their validities or tracing their origins and implications. Selected contemporary issues arising from the city’s sustainable development will also be discussed, such as migration, inequality, and affordable housing. Integrating experiential learning and e-learning strategies, this course should offer students a range of new learning experiences and new angles of approaching the Hong Kong society."
