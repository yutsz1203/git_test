The new initiatives of nature conservation in the 21st century in response to globalization and climate change will be addressed towards the end of the course."
"Climate change is a subject of great interest to all concerned about the future of mankind. However, very few people realize that climate has always been changing since the formation of the Earth. Even fewer people realize that the living things in their totality exert a significant influence in shaping the evolution of the climate itself. One striking feature of the current climate change is that it has arisen from the action of one single species Homo sapiens, owing to its ability to master the use of an enormous amount of energy.This course presents the story of the Earth's atmosphere since its inception up to the current time, illustrating the close interactions between the physical world and the living world. Observations about the life phenomenon are discussed, including the role of energy in the sustenance of life, individually and collectively. The changing climate has provided the context for the development of life on Earth, in terms of dispersion and diversity. The glacial periods have also shaped the habits and character of human beings. The arrival of the recent warm interglacial period facilitated the emergence of agriculture, enabling human beings to capture and utilize more energy in their life cycles. It brought about major changes to human beings' way of life as well as significant disruptions to the delicate balance in nature. Major turning points in history such as the emergence of civilizations, the conflict between nomads and pastoralists, wars and maritime colonialism are discussed in the climate context. Industrial revolution and modern consumerism are discussed in terms of their energy consumption and the associated emission of greenhouse gases, which has given rise to the current man-made climate change. Other aspects of this enormous use of energy are discussed, including urbanization, the attrition of the self and human beings' increasing detachment from nature. Latest projections of the climate in the 21st century and the potential consequences are presented. How the human world would deal with the potential of hazardous climate change will be explored, including the particular problems faced by China as it is about to develop further. It would be a time to reflect on the core human values and how they are to be expressed in the new low-energy world."
"This course will provide an introduction of China’s major environmental crises at local, regional, national and global scales and at different stages of development. It covers topics from air pollution (both indoor and outdoor), water shortage (due to the lack of water resources and water pollution), soil pollution, waste management, desertification & deforestation, energy transition and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as climate change. The foci will not only cover the causes and seriousness of the crises from the perspectives of science, technology, society and governance, but also solutions and emerging norms related to the topics. The course endeavors to inspire students to reflect on their own communities and how to approach sustainable development goals at a variety of scales.Multiple of the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals are closely relevant to the lectures, including (7) Affordable and Clean Energy, (6) Clean Water and Sanitation, (13) Climate Action, (12) Responsible Consumption and Production, (9) Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, and (17) Partnerships for the Goals. This course uses an interdisciplinary approach to lead students through relevant key topics. Students from most departments in natural sciences, engineering, social sciences, public health, and business management will be able to find connections between these topics and their own disciplines. The approach will provide students chances to independently think about the problems beyond any discipline. Because environmental problems are frequently reflected in social and individual daily lives, the course will make students more informed in the increasingly globalizing society for their better contribution to more sustainable development."
"Climate change, sea level rise, deforestation, forest fire, severe typhoon, glacier melt, agricultural loss, overpopulation, etc. are terms that you might have heard of. And they are also real and hot crises affecting the sustainability of human beings. How do we know these are all happening? In fact, our earth is being overseen from space every day. One good example is Google Earth that takes us any part of the globe anytime and anywhere using fingertips. Have you wondered where do these images come from? How these images are captured? How can images be used to understand the happening on our earth? Most of these images are captured by giant machines hovering in space known as satellites. “Remote sensing” is the process to collect images from the space or in the air, which is one of the key tools in the regime of spatial information technology. Important information are extracted from these images to gain better understanding of status quo and be more sustainable and responsible to our home – Earth.This course allows students to acquire basic knowledge of remote sensing and to understand how the technology is used to the study and monitor of our earth. The course is divided into two parts. The first part elucidates the basic concept of remote sensing as well as the skills in extracting information from images. The second part unveils the applications of remote sensing images to crucial sustainability issues such as urban development, agriculture, forest management, natural disaster, climate change, etc. These applications connect with three Sustainable Development Goals including #11 (sustainable cities and community), #13 (climate action) and #15 (life on land) set by the United Nations in 2015. Loads of remotely-sensed images are used to illustrate the natural process and human activities that alter the earth surface and to explore the issue of sustainability. Together with hands-on work in tutorials and interactive class activity, students would be aware of how this novel technology is exploring the future of human beings."
"Music is an art and a science. Questions like “how do we perceive music,” “how does music arouse emotions in us,” “can artificial intelligence (AI) perceive music like us,” “how can AI recognize emotions expressed in music,” “can AI arouse emotions in us through music” are all scientific in nature. This interdisciplinary course invites students to analyse and appreciate music from two scientific perspectives, namely, psychology and AI. It begins with musical elements, which are the basic building blocks of music, from the viewpoint of both music perception and production. The science behind those elements is explored with an emphasis on how they evoke emotions. We then examine the basic concepts of AI and its capability of producing music applications including music emotion recognition and automatic music composition. Along with interactive lectures, students will engage in hands-on experiences and class discussions that culminate towards various music-related AI projects. No prior knowledge in music or programming is required."
"As the most populous country in the world, China is confronted by the problems of overpopulation, water scarcity, energy shortage, desertification, drought, floods, pollution, and loss of biodiversity. Since 1978 the economy has grown rapidly and as of to date, it has become a rising economic power of the world. However, the environmental and ecological problems have reached a point whereby sustainable growth is jeopardized. To solve the problems of limited resource per capita, as well as encourage economic development, China has implemented and planned for a series of mega projects of far-reaching repercussions, the scale of which is unmatched in the history of mankind. They range from multi-purpose water conservancy projects to renewable energy projects and inter-provincial railway construction. These projects have been conceived for decades yet highly controversial and expensive to build. Meanwhile, China has made a commitment that it will shoulder the responsibility of implementing the 2030 development agenda (17 Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs), and seek solidarity and cooperation to constantly push the cause of global development. This course gives students a general background of these mega-projects, the problems they attempt to resolve, benefits, as well as how these projects trying to meet the SDGs (especially the SDGs 6, 7 and 13 of water scarcity, affordable clean energy and climate actions, respectively), and the potential collaborations with other countries contributing to human well-being. After taking this course, students should have a comprehensive understanding about the occurrence, nature and sustainable solutions of the various environmental problems China is facing."
"Globalization processes have been affecting every nook and corner of the world. We are all fascinated by the mushrooming of transnational companies; the increasing cross-boundary flows of resources as well as the increasing competition among places and cities. Resource becomes a keen issue due to the growth of population, trade and economy in the age of globalization. Good management of resources will thus be both global and local concerns. In this regard and with the advent of the global agenda 2030, there is increasing enthusiasm in addressing the most pressing and challenging issues that the world is facing today, and these are Globalization and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).This course will thus focus on the interaction of man and environment in a geographical context with special reference to a selection of relevant SDGs. By adopting different perspectives, a variety of resource issues ranging from natural resources to economic and human resources will be examined. The course will be divided into two parts. The first part will be the discussion of basic concepts of globalization and resource issues in the society that are related to selected SDGs. The second part will be issue-based analyses of different resource issues that affect lives in modern societies and that could make a difference in the pursuit of the SDGs particularly in this age of globalization. Various cases in the real world will be analyzed. This course will help students to broaden their views on the SDGs and understand the importance and implications of resource issues in both developing and developed countries."

Some ethical, legal and social issues generated from genetic research and biotechnology will also be discussed. This course is particularly suitable to those students who are not life science majors but want to understand more on the recent research on human genome and biotechnology, and their impacts on our future worlds."
"Throughout human history, we have developed different ways to strive for living in nature. Among which, agriculture is the foundation of all sedentary civilizations as it systematically provides food and other products to sustain human lives. It is an art that integrates knowledge of nature with human needs and values, evolving side by side with the development of science and technology. Today, with the advancement of scientific technology, the highly industrialized modern agriculture has greatly increased food production to support the global population growth. Yet it also brings global ethical concerns regarding sustainability, food safety, biotechnology, pollution, etc. In the past decades, increasing attention has been given to permaculture, an alternative agricultural practice that emphasizes the development of durable and self-sufficient ecosystems in farming. Permaculture is not only a practice of sustainable food production, it is also a philosophy of living with nature.In this course, students will learn through lectures the basic knowledge about modern agriculture and its applications of science and technology; understand the fundamental principles, philosophy, and practice of permaculture; discuss the ethical issues related to the use of science and technology in modern agriculture; reflect on the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, such as “Zero Hunger”, “Affordable and Clean Energy”, “Sustainable Cities and Communities”, and “Responsible Consumption and Reproduction”. Students will also experience the practices of modern agriculture and permaculture by making site-visits to enterprises of the agricultural industry, and to institutes practicing permaculture. Students who finish this course will be able to describe and compare the major principles and practices of modern agriculture and those of permaculture, analyze the ethical issues related to modern agriculture in contemporary societies, and formulate personal views on how to live more ethically with nature."
"Environmental protection is an important part of modern civilization for the fact that human life and the sustainable development of society are based on natural resources from the environment. While there are common principles and practices for protecting the environment, local contexts might add to the intricacy between humans and their environment, and thus create multiple perspectives for intellectual pursuits. For example, cities in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) share and enjoy a lot of marine resources in the Pearl River Delta. However, coastal cities in the GBA, including Hong Kong and Shenzhen have been heavily impacted by pollution arising from rapid economic transformations and industrial developments in the last few decades. For such a global issue, concerted efforts have been made in scientific studies, implementation of international policies and strengthening of local governance to restore the damaged environment and properly manage our natural resources. Progress has been made but environmental issues remain a huge challenge to mankind.This course aims to engage students in re-examining some current strategies for environmental protection at national, regional, local and even personal levels, by guiding them to study selected prevailing environmental problems, general practices of the society and some representative interregional collaborations in the GBA. While general principles in environmental science will be outlined, this course will focus on water resources, management of pollution in the coastal area and regional collaborations upon the issues. To gain first-hand experience in the present situation of their own city and neighbouring regions, students from CUHK and CUHK(SZ) will participate in field trips and scientific investigations. Tutorial discussions and writing assignments are learning opportunities for students to reflect on and evaluate the implementation of current environmental policies and interregional collaborations in the Greater Bay Area, in terms of the possibilities those policies and collaborations have brought, their significance and issues arising from them. The course serves as a platform across human experience and knowledge for students to exchange ideas, propose new ideas and embark on the journey to a better world as local inhabitants and global citizens."

The impact of cooking and cleaning methods on the environment (in terms of particulates and radiation) will be discussed. Some demonstrations will be carried out in class."
"Hong Kong is very famous for its superb cuisine, which is a fantastic fusion of eastern and western styles. Cooking is both an art and a science. Good tasting foods and drinks are the results of perfect matches of ingredients and cooking methods. Foods and drinks is related to chemistry closely. Having some understanding about the chemistry of the food ingredients and the various cooking methods can help appreciating the connections between science and human life. This course will discuss the Hong Kong cuisine culture from the chemistry perspective, to explain why these famous foods and drinks are so tasty and popular. Examples include Chinese rotisserie (Siu Mei), wonton noodles, steamed seafoods, stewed beef brisket, silk stocking milk tea, and century egg with pickled ginger, etc. Consuming food and soups that carry health and therapeutic values is also a unique food culture in China and Southeast Asia. The course will introduce several types of food that are traditionally considered to have some specific functions, and discuss their scientific justifications from the chemistry point of views. Besides, pre-packaged food and fast food is an important eating culture of modern urban people. Some important issues about pre-packaged food and fast food, such as food storage and packaging, uses of approved (and sometimes prohibited) food additives, alternative ingredients, and food testing, will also be discussed."
"The course UGEB2460 is an ""appreciation"" course on mathematics. As such, its emphasis is on the ""appreciation"" aspect and not on the detailed technicalities of mathematics.The course is designed for all students, except those majoring in Mathematics, Mathematics Education and Mathematics and Information Engineering.In this course, we outline through everyday examples how mathematicsshapes our contemporary world. These examples are based on simple, yet clever ideas which can be explained to the widest audience.It is hoped that through the course, students can get a feeling of ""how mathematics works"". We will look at examples from mobile phones, from GPS, computer graphics, ATM machines, voting systems, forensic detection of accounting forgery, computer graphics, Escher's paintings, quasicrystals, world atlas constructions etc."

"(UGEB2502 is double-coded with ANTH2810.)  What does it mean to be human? Where did we come from? Where are we going? This course investigates long-term evolutionary perspectives on the human species. The basics of evolution and natural selection as scientific theories are clearly set out and examined, and common misconceptions discussed. Evidence for the evolution of mammals and primates is reviewed and discussed, and the common characteristics of these species are highlighted, demonstrating the connections between humans and other forms of life. The course covers what we know about human ancestors and the evolution of modern humans. Students are introduced to the wide range of human adaptations to local conditions across contemporary cultures and the variety of relationships that human populations have with the environment. Students are encouraged to use the knowledge they have acquired to ask: are these relationships always sustainable? Looking to the future: what are our responsibilities both to future generations of humans and towards other species with which we share our world? This course aims to give students an understanding and appreciation of evolutionary perspectives on the place of humans in the world, the variety of contemporary human societies, and a broad perspective on the complexity of the relationship between humans, the environment and other species."
"(UGEB2505 is double-coded with ANTH2740.) How we understand the past defines the way how we understand our current situation. Archaeology is a dynamic discipline that has tremendously expanded our knowledge about the past, but this subject is not just about digging and doing fieldwork. A wide range of new techniques (e.g., metallurgy, zoology, and 3d stimulation) and research methods have been incorporated into current archaeological research, and eventually transformed the understanding of ourselves and our culture in many ways. This course provides a general introduction in terms of two specific domains: 1) basic archaeological science that changed the research paradigm of human culture and history; 2) an overall history about ancient technology illustrated by new research techniques to explain how this modern world took shape. Moreover, this course provides hands-on practice to cultivate students’ cross-disciplinary research skills and prepare them for the arrival of a new, digitalized research era."
"The course aims at studying the human exploration of astronomical phenomena in the history, thereby disclosing the interplay between astronomical activities and the cultural, social, and scientific aspects of human lives, as well as the deep and authentic relation between the celestial bodies and the lives on earth.

"One in every 10 people suffers from at least a kind of communication disorder. It is almost inevitable for people to have encountered individuals with unclear speech, hoarse voice, stuttering, autism spectrum disorder, hearing impairment and dementia etc. in their lifetime. Students without a background in speech and hearing sciences may not have solid understanding of the essentials of human communication and its disorders. This course thus aims to provide tailor-made content suiting all students to cover the fundamentals of these topics from the perspective of speech-language-pathology. The course consists of 3 major components. The first one brings out the essential elements in normal communication. The second component covers what goes wrong in the chain of communication which leads to various communication disorders. The third component introduces various communication disorders in terms of the general characteristics and the practical tips on how to interact with them through case studies. By learning the essential elements of effective communication skills as well as gaining knowledge on how to facilitate interaction with people who have diverse communication and educational needs, this course also helps students to better understand the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) relating to #3 Good Health and Well-being, #4 Inclusive Quality Education and #10 Reduced Inequalities."
