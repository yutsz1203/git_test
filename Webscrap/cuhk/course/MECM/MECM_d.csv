"This course focuses on current issues in curriculum development and assessment in early childhood education (ECE). Technical, deliberative/ practical and critical approaches to curriculum development in ECE will be explored. Participants will be encouraged to reflect on their own practices and examine issues which are likely to be covered: curriculum continuity between kindergarten and primary school; values education in the early childhood curriculum; multiple intelligences and their application in curriculum development and assessment; whole language approach; information technology in education; portfolio assessment; and sociocultural theories for early childhood curriculum."
"This course focuses on two important aspects in early childhood education: educational leadership and management. It is to emphasize that leadership and management are of paramount importance to the success of any organization, including ECE institutions. It is leadership and management that make organizations efficient and effective. This course blends the theoretical concepts of leadership and management with practice, enabling the participants to refine and improve their practice. By the end of the course, students will be familiar with a number of theories and perspectives of leadership and management; be able to critically analyze different perspectives and theories; have developed a position on what they believe ‘good’ leadership and management entailed in Hong Kong schools in general, and more specifically within their workplace context; and be able to discuss the various educational leadership and management issues in Hong Kong schools and their relationship with educational reform."
"This course focuses on the current issues from a comparative perspective. It aims to expound the divergent and convergent trends among educational policies, educational practices and issues related to early childhood education. The following issues are likely to be examined: educational governance and finance; home-preschool collaboration; early childhood education and care policy; early childhood school-based curriculum reform; preschool special education, preschool improvement and new trends in early childhood educational research. Through a comparison of the rationales, initiatives in early childhood education in different societies, participants will be able to examine the local development of early childhood education in a wider context."
"Studies of early childhood from birth to eighth year of age will be introduced in this course which includes the characteristic periods of infants, toddlers, preschool and kindergarten kids, and children of early primary grades. The course is to develop students’ insights into early childhood’s physical, motor, intellectual, emotional, social, and aesthetic growth. Major developmental theories/perspectives will be discussed, analyzed, and compared. The key issues that will be highlighted are concerned with developmental and learning mechanisms, domain-general and domain-specific development, and nature-nurture relationship. Reflecting upon relevant social policy and educational initiatives. The challenges will be analyzed of translating observations and theories of child development into child care and education practices at home and at school."
"The role of sign mediation is regarded as essential in the development of higher psychological processes. In this course, you are invited to explore the rich varieties of signs and their role in the development of mind in early childhood. There are two key concerns in the course: (1) In what ways are meaning making and the development of mind related to children's experience with signs such as languages, mathematics, and visual and expressive arts? (2) How could learning activities be designed to facilitate the understanding, appropriation, and creation of signs? To deepen our understanding of the complexity involved, perspectives from semiotics and the cultural-historical activity theory would be introduced. Insights from research works on the relation between signs and thought, as well as the interaction between sign mediation and human mediation, the creation of the zone of proximal development, and the integration of signs in children's activities, would be drawn to inform the educational practice and the actual design of learning activities. Drawing from different sources of stimulations, we aim to arrive at rich possibilities of designing meaningful activities for facilitating the early development of human mind."
"Participants will participate in a small project under the guidance and support of practicum supervisors. They may either undertake the project individually or in pairs if the topic and context allows. The focus of study may be related to organizational, curriculum, teaching and learning aspects in pre-schools or other early childhood educational organizations or other themes with permission of supervisor. Participants will be placed in small support groups who are expected to share experiences and exchange ideas gained from the project."
"This course aims to provide opportunity for participants to gain actual experience of early childhood education in or outside of Hong Kong, leading to a reflection on the existing practice in early childhood settings by making connections between research and practice. During the tour, participants will visit local or overseas institutions specializing in early childhood education, nurseries, kindergartens, and exchange on children development and curriculum implementation, as well as collect relevant data on early childhood education setting. Students are required to submit a study report after the visits."
