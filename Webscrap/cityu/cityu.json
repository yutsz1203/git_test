More specifically, the course draws on interdisciplinary research in psychology, anthropology, sociology, and history to illustrate how humans construct views of the self, with implications for work and social behaviour. Students will learn the value of (biased) self-views, and how to attain self-knowledge that predicts better performance and social outcomes. Students will also learn about self-stereotyping and the effects on behaviour and achievement. There will be a group project devoted to analyzing specific real-world issues in which knowledge of the self is important. In a personal, group, business or cross-national context, students will examine different ways in which self-knowledge and self-serving biases affect decision-making or leadership.\n\n\nTo provide an overview of the concepts and theories in how people understand the self\n\nTo develop skills in applying those concepts and theories to analyze individual, interpersonal, group, and organizational factors that influence judgments of the self, with implications for work and social behaviour \n\nTo enhance self-knowledge and develop critical thinking, communication skills, and interpersonal skills\n\nTo provide hands-on practice with those skills using case analysis and group work"

Fluid mechanics provides a theoretical foundation while hydraulics focuses on the engineering applications of fluid properties. In pipe flows, hydraulics concerns the study of fluid power for the generation, control, and power transmission by using pressurized fluid. For open channels, it normally refers to flows in a duct partially filled with liquid or in a channel open to the atmosphere. Water flows in rivers and irrigation ditches are examples of open-channel flows. In general, flow in a pipe is driven either gravity or a pressure difference while flow in a channel is driven naturally by gravity. Hydraulics studies cover pipe flows, pumps, turbines, flow measurement, computational fluid dynamics, river channel behaviour and erosion, canals, lakes, estuaries, seas, etc."

The field of nanoscience with its promise of amazing nanotechnologies is one of today\u2019s most challenging, exciting, multidisciplinary and competitive fields, and one of the most highly funded. One might imagine it as a pretty specialized field, while in reality it is just the opposite. In NANO, the idea is to do something really big and important with objects that are really small. It is a field full of challenges that cannot be met by any one specialist of any particular scientific field. In order to be competitive in the global education and economy, Hong Kong universities and emerging nanotechnology companies need creative and competent personnel trained to cross borders between scientific fields. Being interdisciplinary by definition, NANO is the field of science and technology perfectly suited to provide this kind of training to natural science, health science, and engineering students. Moreover, this is the emerging field where the students from social sciences, humanities, business and media need basic knowledge, both in order to provide further education for the public about the scientific, technological and ethical issues of NANO and to be able to critically analyze decisions of policy makers and plan future important financial investments.This course does not require and does not utilize any subject-specific knowledge (no math!).

This course introduces the principles and concepts of applying AI and AR to manufacturing and operations that reduce operating costs and extend asset lifetime, including equipment, machines, lines, and even plants. Industry 4.0 has brought AI technologies, such as machine learning and data analytics, to manufacturing and operations that enable smart manufacturing and check orders, processes, and external factors in real-time. The collected information arms manufacturers with insights they can use to plan for diverse contingencies. Using AR in manufacturing and operations can provide a virtual representation of a real-world asset. This virtual representation is more than just a physical object model because it can continuously receive data input from the smart sensors embedded in the asset that provides a clearer picture of real-world performance and operating conditions to reduce costs. Manufacturers can also simulate the real-world environment for predictive maintenance."

At the structure level, we attempt to discover the underlying network of causes and feedbacks leading to the observed patterns (\"The manager cut expenditure by laying off technical support staff. As a result, the IT analysts got increasing workloads. Then some IT analysts started to resign, creating even more workload for the remaining IT analysts, and leading to more resignations.\"\u0080\u009d) This course aims to introduce the elements of systems thinking \"a methodology for comprehending, at the structure level, why things happen\" so that our students, regardless of their majors, can achieve a higher understanding of phenomena surrounding them. The main questions to be studied are: What constitutes a system? How to identify its components and their inter-relations (e.g. causation, feedback)? How to model a system as a network of its components? We will use the basic tools from systems thinking (understandable by university students of any major) to answer these questions.

It comprises two components: experiential learning and professional onsite teaching. For experiential learning, students have the opportunity to come into direct contact with the relics and cultural heritages at the historical sites. The 4-week field investigation provides them with an appropriate learning environment to absorb the significance of cultural connotation and cultural exchange which are related to their learning. Where possible, they can have the opportunity to experience the cultural activities such as ancient arts performance, ancient pottery making, archaeological excavations, etc. For professional onsite teaching, the instructors will guide the students and discuss the theme of the course during the field trip which will help further strengthen our teaching concepts. Instructors will coordinate with the students to set the objectives, methods and expectations of the field trip and reflect on how the results of the investigation can be used effectively in the group project. The onsite teaching enables students to have a more holistic understanding on the relationships between the historical and present aspects of cultural development.

Cultural exchanges and the processes of contestation and negotiation that go with it often take place within the context of political, economic, social, and technological shifts. In this sense, culture exchange does not necessarily mean a simple relationship of giving and receiving from other cultures. Trans-cultural encounters often result in transforming all the parties involved, and even in cultural hybridity.\u00a0This course aims to provide basic knowledge and scholarly frameworks to examine cultural exchanges in Hong Kong, Chinese, East Asian, and global contexts. We examine movements of people, commodities, and ideas that have shaped diverse expressions of cultures in these contexts, such as the cultural journeys of objects that are most basic to our everyday lives. To do this, we will draw from history to pursue a longer and more grounded view of what globalization mean, and also to rethink our presumed cultural traditions. With the pronounced flow of cultural forces on a global scale, we also need to be highly aware of the contemporary connectivity of economic, cultural, political, and social activities in different parts of the world. We will try to develop an understanding of the dynamics of these global flows in shaping the emerging and fluctuating world order.\u00a0This course analyzes these themes interdisciplinarily, with approaches drawn from the history of cultural contact, sociology, cultural studies, and anthropology. Through examining the interface of global, domestic, and trans-border cultures, this course helps students gain a better understanding of how exchange and contact is always critical to the making and remaking of culture(s).

In this sense discovering the past is nothing but searching for cultural identity and to a certain extent, cultural identity even can be invented in an ideological sense. In a globalized i.e. capitalized context, the issue of searching for cultural identity shows the tension between traditionalist and modernist ideology, particularistic and universalistic ideology, nationalist and imperialist/colonialist ideology, etc..

        "courseDescription": "The shift from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 has provided new tools of self-expression which are significantly different from traditional forms of self-presentation and autobiographical writing. Explicit, linguistic forms of self-expression are increasingly replaced by automated recordings of personal data. The resulting post-human autobiography is an assemblage of deliberate utterances and automated records. Thus identity is constructed as a datafied mirror of a person\u2019s actions rather than as a result of self-reflection. The course discusses this issue by exploring traditional and contemporary theory and practice of narration in identity construction and aims at providing students with a critical understanding of how new media operate and the ability to express themselves and generate an online-identity in the most effective and meaningful way. Subjects discussed in the course\u2019s sessions are: self-narration on Facebook, identity and the postmodern subject, the role of narration in identity construction, episodic and narrative concept of identity, photography as indexical concept of memory, numerical narratives via database, the Internet as archive, perfect memory and the right to forget, self tracking and the quantified self."

Grammar, instead, is a set of strategies that a speaker employs in order to produce coherent communication. If grammar is for communication, then some important questions follow, which constitute the themes of this course and will be answered one by one:\u2013 How can a grammar be used for communication?\u2013 Why do different languages have different \u201crules\u201d?\u00a0\u2013 What are the grammatical rules in English meant to communicate?\u00a0\u2013 Why are they the way they are?\u00a0To fulfil communicative purposes, a grammar must provide \u2018means\u2019 for speakers to communicate whatever they want to communicate. Then the task of teaching grammar is not just about \u201cwhat\u201d, but also involves \u201cwhy\u201d, since what is in the grammar (the rules) is motivated by what needs to be communicated (the functions). The course proposes a fundamental challenge to the traditional grammar teaching method in exploring the mapping relations between form and function. Each language has a unique way of associating form and meaning, just as different people have different personalities. The course is meant to capture English grammar by understanding its unique \u201cpersonality\u201d in terms of form-function mapping strategies."

Examples include 'work integration social enterprises' (WISEs) that employ stigmatized groups (e.g., ex-criminals, people with disability, homeless, refugees, ethnic minority) and socially innovative ventures (e.g., new types of transitional housing, taxis that cater to the elderly, etc). New developments in this area include Certified B Corporation, platform cooperatives, to the use of blockchain and AI to assist poor farmers; many of whom also employ social enterprise models.\nThis course aims to educate students as positive agents of development and responsible citizens by equipping them with the theories, concepts, and tools to be social entrepreneurs. The skills learned in this course is equally applicable to conventional (for-profit) entrepreneurship. The course integrates Western and non-Western theories, practices, and cases to social entrepreneurship, and thus offers a unique design in the world. As social entrepreneurship is multidimensional, this course adopts a multi-disciplinary approach by combining humanities, public sector management, business management, design, information and communication technology, and technology management."

        "courseDescription": "Service leadership is concerned with \"satisfying needs by consistently providing quality service to everyone one comes into contact with, including one self, others, communities, systems, and environments\" (Chung, 2011). Nowadays\u00a0 employers are placing new importance on service leadership from new hires and\u00a0 graduates.\u00a0 Not suprisingly, universities incorporate service leadership in their academic and extracurricular programmes.\nIn all contexts, from business, non-government organizations, government, to self-employment, service leadership is becoming a key ingredient for success. Service leadership is particularly important because Hong Kong, and most developed economies, is quintessentially a service economy. That is, a high proportion of their economic activities come from the services sector.\u00a0\u00a0With increasing education and income among consumers and rapid deployment of new technologies in services, consumers place\u00a0higher expectations on services. To cope with this change, it is important to understand what service leadership is, what it consists of, how it works, and its implications to improve services across all contexts.\u00a0 This will also contribute to Hong Kong's continuing success as a service leader in China and the region.\u00a0\nThis course is suitable for students from all disciplines. As an introductory level course, students can bring the key elements of service leadership to reflect on and apply it to their professional areas. Whatever professions that students may take up after graduation, knowledge of service leadership will enhance their success at work and in life."

Specialization in education can narrow the mind of students, which make them fail to see that they can deal with the issues in one domain by drawing a parallel from the success in another domain. It is therefore important to introduce students the generic principles of rationality and the art of creative thinking and to teach them how to apply them in their daily lives and moral reasoning, and across different disciplines and professions. This course was designed with the aim to achieve such objectives by adopting an interdisciplinary approach. Current affairs and daily life examples, and cases in different academic and professional disciplines are used to illustrate the principles of rationality, the art of creative thinking and their applications. Upon completing the course, students should be able to acquire the styles of higher-order self-reflexive thinking that can help them transcend different domains of practical and ethical reasoning and the boundaries of tradition disciplines and professions.\nThe pedagogical approach of this course is interactive.

Motion pictures have long been used to advocate social policies, set political agendas, or win propaganda battles. They often both challenge and uphold traditional institutions and values. Over one semester, a set of internationally acclaimed, award-winning films will be screened in class and used as a tool for surveying and improving our understanding of a wide range of topical issues and concepts from the democracy literature. They include elections, voting rights, the role of a free press, dissent and repression, the rule of law, lobbying and corruption, among others. In addition to different strategies to formulate arguments and write about political movies, students will also be exposed to key social science readings on the concepts raised by each film screened in class. While recognizing the impact of the US movie industry, the course will move beyond Hollywood and critically survey Asian and European films.The aim of the course is to equip students with instruments and skills to discuss ideas about, against, or in favour of the idea of democracy in their everyday lives, and beyond.

Attention is focused on relations between the state, society and the economy in national settings rather than on cross-national forces around the world that are studied in courses on globalisation. The East Asian region as a whole and the influence of one state's development on another are considered. It thus places economic development and political trajectories in a larger regional and historical context. Statist interventions in national economies have produced some of the world's fastest rates of economic growth under authoritarian developmentalist regimes. But the regimes in the region have faced a dilemma, as rapid modernization, economic crises and/or corruption have often threatened their hold on power. They have thus balanced efforts to upgrade economically with the maintenance of political control."

Why do some movements scale up and become transnational? Why do movements dissipate? This course, designed as an overview of the social movements and contentious politics literature, will help you explore these questions.

What kinds of political structures are in place in societies without state bureaucracies? How did colonialism and industrial capitalism transform the power geometries of world politics? Do rituals and symbols still matter to modern nation-states? Is nationalism a social disorder or a source of social solidarity? In Part II, we turn to the topics of domination and resistance. Under what conditions do citizens engage in mass movements of civil disobedience? What may be the limits to the concept of civil society in catching the diverse forms of resistance? How do everyday practices challenge or reproduce existing power structure without actively engaging with or explicitly resisting to the state? In Part III, we investigate the seemingly apolitical practices and experiences that (re)produce power structures and provide political legitimacy. Why do Malagasy cows speak French? In what way is our perception of money shaped by power relationships and social structure? How are charity organizations complicit with capitalisim in reproducing social inequality? Do artefacts have politics? What are the main characteristics of contemporary forms of technocratic government?This course focuses less on formal political structures and movements and more on the diverse ways and forms in which power travels through different socio-cultural contexts. In doing so, students will be exposed to various theoretical frameworks and thinkers, including Marxism, STS, Weber, Foucault and others, with specific case studies."

Specifically, ICTs provide effective and efficient means for organizing people and ideas, offer greater access to information, knowledge and education, and increase the efficiency and collaboration. This course takes the position that professional social workers are ethically obligated to advance their services through careful and thoughtful application of ICTs. To achieve this goal, social work students should be able to (1) identify the need of using ICTs to improve the service in a given situation through a careful analysis of the system flow in the daily work process, so that they can ensure that ICT developments or upgrades are a good fit and contain the information needed to obtain support for the best outcomes for the service users; and (2) gain the knowledge and skills to understand and use ICTs to achieve a specific purpose (i.e., competencies), in addition to knowing the major concepts and language associated with ICT (i.e., literacy). This one semester course aims to equip students with knowledge and understanding, and practical skills to approach problems of information processing and information management and the application of ICTs in the social work environment in a positive, constructive, and informed manner. Assuming no technical knowledge, this course analyses the current context and use of ICTs in the social work sector; provides the ideas, tools and resources to think critically and creatively about current ICT practice; and helps students design a simple and innovative information system/application that will implement positive change at individual, team or organisational level."

Its forms of violence are widespread covering physical, psychological, emotional, financial and sexual maltreatment. The extent of the problem also covers wide ranges of relationship including spousal, intimate partners, cohabiting, dating violence, child, sibling, and elder abuse. Interventions should also be multiple levels and interdisciplinary involving the legal, health and mental health, housing, public assistance, child and victim protection systems. Facing with increasingly complicated issue of domestic violence, social workers should be well-equipped with knowledge, skills and competence to identify, assess, and intervene with individuals (including victims, survivors, and perpetrators) and families where domestic violence is present or happened in the past.\u00a0Therefore, the focus of the course is on the methods of assessment, intervention, and prevention used to address and end the major forms of domestic violence. It will address the seriousness and extent of the problem, contributing and protective factors, consequences for the individual, the family, the community and society. Models of multi-levels, inter-systems, and interdisciplinary collaboration relating to domestic violence will also be discussed. In the meantime, students will be encouraged to (1) explore their own attitudes toward domestic violence, as well as public and professional values that may block effective interventions, and (2) understand and critically review the theories, policies, organizations, legislations and interventions which contribute to zero tolerance of the problem.\u00a0\u00a0This course aims to enable students to:\u00a0\u00a0Acquire knowledge and different theoretical perspectives to understand different forms of domestic violence.Develop professional competence in assessing and providing effective interventions for the victims, survivors and abusers of domestic violence with multi-levels, inter-systems, and interdisciplinary collaboration.Develop professional competence in designing and promoting preventive programmes related to domestic violence."

        "courseDescription": "In Hong Kong, student suicides have been a key concern in recent years. Suicidal behaviours among young students are often complicated involving multiple contributing factors and causal pathways. No single stressor could be enough to explain a suicide. Ironically, emotional distress and relational problems often act interactively, on the one hand, as risk factors to increase an individual\u2019s vulnerability to suicidal behaviour, and, on the other hand, as protective factors to increase one\u2019s resilience and connectedness, thus also help in suicidal prevention. In Hong Kong, we now have \u201cone school with two social workers scheme\u201d in secondary schools. School social work service has also been extended to primary and pre-primary schools. When school setting becomes one of the important contexts in social work practice, social workers should be well-equipped with knowledge, skills, and practice competence in understanding and handling emotions and relations of young students.\u00a0In this course, students will explore the current scientific knowledge regarding the nature, functions, and processes of emotions and social interactions. Of particular interests will be the role of emotions in rational thinking and effective interpersonal behaviours, and its relational outcomes. On the basis of such understanding, students will discuss on the wisdom of emotions and practice making good use of emotions to enhance intrapersonal well-being, interpersonal relations, and problem solving."

To keep up social work students with the most up-to-date social and knowledge development, this module deals with social work intervention approaches which include both conventional practice models for new problems and new practice models for old problems. It seeks to reveal the philosophical underpinnings, assumptions and characteristics of selected intervention approaches, and embrace diverse values and interpretations to issues concerned, and how to realize such interpretation in terms of approaches, and what particular process and skills are needed to implement such practice models.

The theoretic core of the machine learning consists of three elements: the mathematics to characterize the hidden structures and relations of the data, the statistical learning theories to build the correct models and assessment tools, and lastly, the computational algorithms to practically solve the final numerical problems.\n\r\nThis elective course is to provide the elementary mathematical and numerical theories relevant to the machine learning for data sciences. The basic knowledge of linear algebra, probability theory and statistical models is required and the familiarity of basic numerical methods and one programming language (Python or R or MATLAB or C or SAS, etc) is also preferred or required. The course will discuss fundamental rules, major classes of models, and principles of standard numerical methods. There will be a careful balance between heuristic vs rigorous, simple vs general. The perspective is from the applied and computational mathematics rather than an attitude of \"alchemy\"\u0080\u009d. This course is a highly integrated undergraduate course for computational math major and it has a wide spectrum in various math knowledge and computational techniques. It can be also a companion theoretic course to a hands-on-experience-oriented machine learning course, for engineering major students with an exceptional math background.\n\r\nThis course will introduce the basic concepts of machine learning (supervision and unsupervised learning) and review the popular models used in machine learning and explain the underlying mathematical theories behind these models: linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machine, Gaussian process regression, model reduction, etc. Besides, this course also focuses on the neural network models. The machine learning algorithms such as unsupervised learning, stochastic gradient descent and deep learning techniques will be also an important part of this course. The examples of specific application will be given as exercises which require some programming work. During this course, the students are encouraged to apply the techniques to solve some realistic appreciations in the framework of Discovery & Innovation Curriculum.

The basic knowledge of linear algebra and elementary analysis is required. The course will also discuss several fundamental and important theorems, for example, the Hahn-Banach theorem, the Riesz-Frechet representation theorem, and the fixed point theorems.

It is a course concerned with the origins of money, the nature of exchange, and how money and themes of exchange are manipulated by artists for aesthetic and ideological purposes.\n\u00a0In \u201cMoney\u201d students will be exposed to an anthropological and aesthetic history of money (contrasting the economic version with alternative histories from anthropology and the art-world). Students will explore theories of money as cultural inscription and as an extension of social and cultural exchange-networks based on trust. Changing technological modes of money will be contextualized within a history that examines how culture changes as exchange changes. This discursive exploration will be framed by an examination of specific artists (from the ancients to the contemporary) who investigate money (cost, value, exchange) or use it as the material in their work.\u00a0An emphasis will be placed on the role of new media in contemporary exchange. \u201cThe genealogy of the money form is the study of a new logic that is the money of the mind\u201d (Shell, 1993, pg.11). In the digital age, physical money as a material structure is on the threshold of obsolescence. Trading is now enacted digitally through databases, flash trading algorithms, micro-transactions, and online auctions. Modes of networked digital money are proliferating: RFID cards, NFC, alternative open source currencies (BitCoins, etc\u2026) and mobile transactions (Google Wallet, PayPal, Square, Card.io etc.). Art is also becoming conceptual, virtual and data-driven. This transition from material money to virtual trade, from material art to virtual visualization, constitutes a shift in culture, and an opportunity to explore the interdependence of economic exchange and cultural inscription.\nThis course aims to destabilize conventional notions of money as simply an economic necessity. Students will be enabled to critically discuss money from a perspective informed by art-history, critical aesthetics and anthropology. Money as material has existed since antiquity; its origins are speculative. Obsidian, copper, cowry shells (first manufactured in China in 1000 B.C.), salt, silk, silver and gold (introduced in Qin dynasty 221 BC) preceded minted coins and bills (which first appeared on leather circa 118 B.C. in China). An aesthetic view of money might consider the sycee gold ingot form used in China up until the 20th century as a sculptural form. Students will gain an expanded understanding of the history of money, an understanding of how technological systems influence transactions, and an exposure to art-activism concerned with money and exchange. \nOne goal of the course is to inculcate a view of money as a dynamic non-trivial cultural system informed by networks that are simultaneously abstract, embodied and digital. Money activates physiological desire systems intimately linked to imagination and subconscious creative impulses (as such it is a natural subject for art). \nBy the end of the course, students will be able to plausibly conjecture about the future technological trajectories of money as it becomes increasingly mobile, virtualized, transparent, networked and immaterial. Students will also be expected to link this anthropological understanding to art-works that investigate exchange."

        "courseDescription": "This course covers video game from four different perspectives: 1.) Historical perspective. 2.) Industry perspective. 3.) Social Impact. 4.) Creative perspective. Student will be exposed to game in the context of its history, design, social impact, and industry. The course will consist of lectures and workshops. Student need to complete 4 reports, 2 written assignments, and 1 group project with presentation.\u00a0 \nThis course aims to explore the many facets of video game and its impact on our society in term of historical, industrial, and societal aspect. \nVideo games had entered in our daily life as one of the most popular form of digital entertainment. Due to its\u00a0 popularity,\u00a0 video game creates an industry which is worth of the\u00a0 USD $54 billion (2008) worldwide. It tops both the movie and music industry in term of market value. Video game is also the subject of intense research activities within the academic world in the recent years.\u00a0 This course aims to facilitate the students to have deeper understanding of this new form of digital media by studying its history, industry, social impact, and the creative process of making video game. . The course is designed with the above mentioned\u00a0 four\u00a0 perspectives in mind.\nHistorical perspective: Video game\u00a0 has colourful history. Starting from the day of \u201cPong\u201d with nothing more than few pixels on screen per second to the current\u00a0 incarnation with millions of polygon per every 0.02 second , many talented people made their very best effort in order to make this progress and create this industry. Those are the pioneers in this industry and each of the pioneers has their own interesting story that is still worth of learning. We will follow the footsteps of those pioneers and share with their stories.\u00a0 In the class, we will talk about the\u00a0 the\u00a0\u00a0 historical events like the introduction of \u201cPong\u201d, rise of Mario (Nintendo), PS2 and Sony, Xbox and Microsoft, development of online games and many others. The stories not only illustrate the fascinating adventures of those creative people involved in the industry and they also illustrate business strategy in this highly competitive market. Student will study the history of video games\u00a0 through assigned readings and by actually playing some of\u00a0 the classical video games. Industry perspective: Video game business is a global business worth of USD $54 billion annually. It is a serious business by any scale.\u00a0 In studying video business,\u00a0 we discuss the famous business cases within video game industry. Famous cases\u00a0 include the rise of Nintendo, SONY strategy on PS and PS 2, Microsoft development of XBOX, and many other cases. Student will be asked to select one of those cases and make a detailed study. They will present their finding in a group presentation. Social Impact: Like all forms of popular media in our society, video games have been the subject of frequent controversy. A large number of studies had been conducted in order to determine its impact on children and adolescents. The positive impact of video games include it improves a player manual dexterity and computer literacy. E.g. The US Navy is using video game to train their helicopter pilots. It achieves very good result in term of cost saving and makes those pilots more adaptable to ever-increasing computer centric operational environment. The negative impact of video games is usually related to the amount of time that a player spent on video games per week and the type of content used in video game. Studies* had shown \u201cAdolescent girls played video games for 5 hours/week, whereas boys averaged 13 hours/week\u201d. The same study also pointed out that teens who play violent content video game for extended periods of time:-\u00a0Tend to be more aggressive.-\u00a0Are more prone to confrontation with their teachers.-\u00a0May engage in fights with their peers.-\u00a0See a decline in school achievements. Video games are also frequently criticized for too narrowly using only violence, sexual themes, consumption of drug/alcohol/tobacco, and profanity as the elements of game themes even though all of these can be found in all forms of entertainment and media. The critics of video games often include parent\u2019s group, politicians, and organized religious group. The gaming industry responses to those critics by establishing video game content rating organization. One of such organizations in North America is Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB). The organization rates video game software for certain age groups and with certain content warnings. In some other countries, e.g. China, the regulator limits the amount of the consecutive hours a player can any online video game to be 3 hours and the player must take a break after 5 hours of consecutive hours of playing. However all those critics and regulation to video games has their own criticism and controversy against them too. The social impact perspective of this course tries to discuss the social and ethical impacts of the video games and guides the students to analyze and criticize controversy issues on video games. Creativity perspective: The reason we like games is simply we like to play. The reason that games are appealing to us is because games can give us good play through a form of challenge. Games pose interesting challenges for us to overcome and we have very enjoyable experience by overcoming the challenges. There are many types (genres) of challenge (video game) that appeal to different people. Broadly speaking, we have games challenged us on spatial reasoning, on pattern recognition, on sequential reasoning, on numerical reasoning, on resource management, and on social reasoning. They are translated into First Person Shooter (FPS), Board Games, War Games, Role-Play Games (with computer helping the number crunching ), Strategy Games, and Games like \u201cThe Sims\u201d. We are going to discuss those genres and dissect the structure\u00a0 within typical commercial games. We will take a hand on approach\u00a0 to teach the students about the design of\u00a0 one of typical genres of video game: the Role Play Game (RPG). It will include writing a story for the game, design the game characters, design the encounter events in the game, and the game rule system.\u00a0 The students will eventually create a paper prototype of their own design which is playable for other students to determine how good their design is. * Gentile, D.

Drawing on the traditions of philosophy of technology and post-phenomenology, the course asks: what is the role of technologies in the construction of human reality? Do technologies add to our quality of life? Where does the human stop and the technology begin? Are some technologies \u201cbetter\u201d or \u201cworse\u201d than others? What is \u201cnew\u201d in the gadgets we are accustomed to calling new technologies? How are science and technology related? Is art possible without technology? Are computer games \u201cless real\u201d than football or badminton? \nThe philosophical questions covered by lectures and in-class discussions based on assigned readings will be rooted on the level of everyday through self-reflective experiments involving technological deprivation and diary-keeping which will be followed up by in-class presentations and/or short papers. The philosophical thinking about technology in this class will ultimately culminate in the final papers.\nThis course aims at presenting the student with a variety of philosophical viewpoints regarding technology in the contexts of science, art, and everyday life, allowing each student A) to arrive at their own reasoned standpoint regarding the role of technology in the contexts of both contemporary life and their own discipline-specific practices and B) express this standpoint both orally and in writing.\nThis will be achieved through 1) lectures, demonstrations and screenings which present case studies of individual technologies and their use-contexts, paying special attention to the ways in which technologies are embedded in practices of scientific research, artistic creation, communication and entertainment, 2) exercises that practically examine the relationships between humans, technologies and the world and 3) discussions that aim at critical assessment of contemporary claims about technology, both utopias and dystopias (such as instances of \u201chype\u201d and \u201cmedia panic\u201d)"

In this course, each student will (in consultation with a SCM faculty, i.e. the Course Leader) select (at least) one scientist and one topic of research, and then spend the semester working independently with that scientist, in order to make first-hand discoveries about the nature of the relation between art and science. The scientist will in many instances be a member of the City University faculty, for instance, a biologist, chemist, physicist, mathematician or engineer. The SCM Course Leader will help students to identify and approach potential scientists to work with, and the student will then develop a proposal for collaboration. During the semester, the student will learn some of the fundamental concepts and methods used by those scientists in their research and then produce an artwork that expresses, utilizes, or responds to those concepts/methods. The emphasis will be on an informed dialogue with science. The student will be expected to achieve at least an introductory understanding of the scientific/mathematical aspects of the work, and to become familiar with methods of data collection, modelling, etc. The student will finally produce an artwork in a medium of her/his choice, such as video documentary, animation, game, interactive installation, sculpture, print(s), photograph(s), etc.\u00a0 The student\u2019s work must show an accurate understanding of the science and an in-depth artistic engagement with it. The student will in many instances identify science students to collaborate with. Since this course stresses independent work, there will be no regular lectures.

The course begins with workshops to generate experiences of creativity, followed by trainings in visual thinking and spatial logic, drawing, photography, video, sound production and aural awareness, which amount to the arts of seeing and hearing in the age of technological convergence. Students are expected to operate, with proficiency, tools of various media, and then gradually generate their own artistic vocabulary. In the process, students are also encouraged to create works with humanitarian sensibilities and concerns, especially via keen observation of the world around them.\nThis course is comprised of a series of technique-focused studios, as well as semi-regular town hall meetings. The ultimate purpose of regular exercises within each \"toolbox studio\" module is to allow the students to befriend a broad range of tools to use and think with them playfully with competence. In addition to regular exercises within each studio module, the course requires all students to integrate what they learn with a first year thesis that demonstrates cross-media thinking and multiple media skills, which will take place in the final weeks of the Semester B.\nSTUDIO MODULES\n1. Creativity in Action: Cross-media Sensibilities\nThis module aims at exposing students to a range of issues pertaining to the integration of artistic tools and cross-media thinking, and to extend and expand their creative vision beyond medium-specificity. Using writing as the initial activity, this module focuses on generating individualized experiences of creativity for each student.\u00a0S/he will learn to generate and develop creative ideas, and to express their thoughts and ideas in innovative and engaging ways.\n2. Drawing and Visual Thinking\nThis is a series of half-day intensive drawing sessions in which students explore both the representational and abstract languages of drawing. The goal of this module is to help students develop an acute sense of visual perception, and to expose students to the various stages involved in the crystallization of inspirations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from keen observation of the world, to personalization and formalization of ideas, to abstraction and/or representation with a given medium. From life drawing, students gradually move on to experimental drawings and other visual creation. In the process of making, basic theories in visuality and perception will be introduced.\n3. Hearing and Sounding\nThe aim of this module is twofold: (1) to build a facility within each student to create sounds in the studio setting; and (2) to help students develop an acute sense of hearing, and to explore listening as an active yet nuanced process. Students will create a variety of sound works using a digital audio workstation, through which they will learn various techniques for audio recording, sound editing, sound transformation and design. Students may also be exposed to ear-opening and aural training exercises, which are aimed at expanding the boundaries / heightening the sensitivity of participants' aural perception.\n4. Objects and Installation\nIn this series of hands-on intensive studios, students explore the fundamental concepts of objects in space, through the creation of three-dimensional art objects and installation. Students are encouraged to investigate both the structural and metaphorical potential of a range of materials.\n5. Video and Digital Imaging\nThis module will focus on the art of digital imaging (photography and video), with an emphasis on developing a level of mastery of these tools as means of artistic expression. The ultimate goal of this module is to empower students to creatively engage two-dimensional imaging. This module is also designed to assist students in developing their own personal visual language through keen observation of the principles of space, shape, colour and movement. Artistic projects range from field photography, digital collage, stop-motion animation to modes of videography.6. Interactive MediaThis module aims at introducing the basic theories and principles of user interface design, interactive installation and physical computing. Students are going to learn a visual programming tool in class.\u00a0TOWNHALL MEETINGS\u00a0The goal of these meetings is to reinforce the importance of a process-oriented approach to art making, and to help students articulate the various stages of the development of their first year thesis, from the gem of an idea to the choice and integration of media to execution. These meetings may take form of faculty panels on a specific topic, guest artist presentations, studio critique sessions, seminars on writing and creativity, aural awareness exercises, or other formats as the instructor see fit."

Social and cultural aspects of games will also be considered.Although the nature of the course is essentially theoretical, students will be required to produce creative projects to fulfill course requirements. Students are free to choose their preferred creative medium. They can, for instance: design games or toys; create multimedia performances that play with urban space; or develop forms of play in literature, film, or interactive formats. The relationship between theory and practice will always be at the forefront. Students must demonstrate an ability to integrate critical reflection and practical creation; this is the core skill that this course aims to nurture."

With a comprehensive list of courses on the practice of photography in place at SCM, this course aims to invite students to think through the many implications of photography and the many possible ways to understand photographic practicess. This course aims at encouraging students in photography to become more informed about the choices they make and the reasons they provide for their photo-making activities. For students who do not specialize in photography, this course enables them to be informed, intelligent users, and be able to benefit from the theoretical thinking of photography to better other areas of academic/artistic pursuits.The first part of the course persuades students to acknowledge the importance and relevance of theory, and that even when we don\u2019t mention theory, our photographic activities always already rest on implicit, unspoken assumptions presented as \u2018common sense\u2019. As Victor Burgin argues, \u201ctheory sets out to question the underlying assumptions of common sense in order to replace them.\u201dEven though this is a theory course, students are invited to walk through selected 20th-century and contemporary thinkers who have contributed to our understanding of photography and photographic practices. While it is still arguable whether photography has a theory of its own, we take the history of photography itself as theory. We will examine theories of image-making, the use of photography in contemporary everyday culture, theories of interpretation and meaning-making, photography within a broader system of picture-making, as well as the social and technological contexts and issues underpinning photography.The last section of the course will deal with the question of where photography began, the impact of digitality on our understanding of photography, and the role of photography in contemporary art.

        "courseDescription": "The many new forms of (digital) screens for moving images sprouting in our urban space indicate the need to reconsider established methods and standards of imaging. \u201cMicro-narratives\u201d is a neologism created for such a purpose: (1) to reflect upon the unspoken (historical) assumptions of existing norms and conventions in order to (2) facilitate free experimentation with new possibilities in making moving images by seeking new sources of inspiration. In the form of a 13-week concept-driven laboratory in videography, an overall sentiment of the course is partly to critique a moving image practice that is dominated by Hollywood traditions, as well as to open up the idea of \u2018narrative\u2019 as a conceptual tool to incite innovations. Narrative-making, therefore, becomes the main subject of the laboratory work in this course: we play with the idea of narrative and the activities of making narratives (narrativity) in order to discover new aspects of image-making and ask forgotten questions about the moving image. This also means we refuse to accept \u201cexperimental film/video\u201d as just a genre with a history of styles. Instead, through the 13-week activities, we ask the question of what it means to experiment, and we provide ethical arguments to why experimentation is essential. The discovery-driven inspiration that make up this laboratory draws from the following sources:1.\u00a0Early Cinema (1895 to 1905-7): this is the moment when the moving image was still in a flux, therefore most exciting with many experimented possibilities, and before business interest gradually reduced cinema to the service of story-telling premised upon the norms of 19th-century realist novel. The idea of \u201cmicro-narratives\u201d asks us not to hastily equate cinema with plot-based story-telling, but, instead, to go directly to the low-level components of the moving image: composition and configuration of space within the frame, motion, duration, movement, montage, performance, contrast, sight and sound relations and so on \u2013 to rediscover the potency of images that move. 2.\u00a0Intermediality at the core of experimentation: \u201cintermedia\u201d is a key concept in contemporary art since the post-WWII era, but also a characteristic pregnant in many Early Cinema experiments. Suspending the notion of a \u201cpure medium,\u201d \u2018intermedia\u2019 celebrates the in-between territories created when the features and concepts of more than one medium are inter-playing in dialog.\u00a0 Many videographic exercises in this course openly invite the using knowledge from painting, literature, music, scoring and notation. The use of the term \u2018micro narrative\u2019 is itself a method of open sexperimentation.3.\u00a0Philosophy: the idea of time and space, especially Gilles Deleuze\u2019s \u201ctime-image\u201d / \u201csound-image\u201d and \u201cmoving image\u201d drawing upon the French New Novel and Henri Bergson\u2019s philosophy of time and so on, converged into a materialist cinema, arguing that cinema is not just a carrier of style and film method, but a new form of consciousness: it enables us to see, perceive and experience the world differently. How does this affect how a moving-image maker think of the meaning of his/her works to the viewers?4.\u00a0Theory of film and photography: Walter Benjamin\u2019s discussion of the optical unconscious in the photographic image and Andre Bazin\u2019s thesis on the moving image\u2019s indexical transparency refresh the videographer\u2019s attention to the descriptive power of the moving image. 5.\u00a0Innovative narrative experiments that deconstruct \u2018narrativity\u2019: e.g. the works of Raul Ruiz, Jean Luc Godard, Peter Greenaway, Alain Resnais, Vera Chytilova, Chantel Akerman etc. with many others normally considered experimental filmmakers reflecting upon and revising existing norms, conventions and forms of moving image creation.We want to challenge, in particular, the popular assumptions and conventions of narrative in mainstream moving image practice, typically:-\u00a0bound by (causal) linearity; -\u00a0entrenched belief in realisms; -\u00a0assuming passive viewing contexts and a language of continuity and narrative absorption, whether in scene constructions or editing style; and -\u00a0equating perception/reception with story comprehension with an over-emphasis on progression and plot-development;"

        "courseDescription": "Machine learning pervades many aspects of contemporary life. In response to this situation, media artists have also started to apply and reflect on machine learning algorithms in their own work. This course introduces basic concepts of machine learning for artists in a hands-on practical way. The focus is not on a rigorous presentation of technical material but on the use of techniques for creative purposes.\u00a0The course will have two parts. First, we will introduce the fundamental concept of machine learning and other related ideas (supervised vs. unsupervised learning, regression vs. classification, etc.) and explore classical algorithms in such areas as clustering, classification, dimensionality reduction, and manifold learning. Instead of jumping directly to advanced topics like deep neural networks, we therefore begin with classical algorithms and fundamental notions to build a strong foundation. The second part will then move on to neural networks and deep learning. Students will learn how to use pretrained models and to design simple networks to perform such tasks as image classification, object recognition, semantic segmentation, depth estimation, etc.\u00a0\u00a0The course will mainly concentrate on practical techniques that artists can use. The focus of the course will be on image processing rather than natural language or sound, but students can develop projects in those areas on the basis of the concepts learnt in class. Students are expected to write their own code in Python and to reflect on the techniques that they use from technical, aesthetic, cultural and social standpoints. These aspects can include, for instance: a description of the history of neural networks and machine learning in relation to eugenics, cybernetics, or warfare; a discussion of the social impact of machine learning on gender, work, poverty, or race; a reflection on the philosophical aspects of machine learning, such as the nature of induction; a discussion of political and social aspects of ImageNet and other popular datasets; an awareness of the tendency of technology to become a black box and the problem of interpretable or explainable AI; questions of resource-use (for instance energy consumption, carbon emission, or impact on climate); data collection, digital labour, and surveillance capitalism; etc.\u00a0\u00a0Assessment will be studio-based. Workshops will be conducted using contemporary languages and frameworks, such as for instance: Python, and the main libraries are scikit-learn, scikit-image, Pytorch, or TensorFlow/Keras. The specific languages to be used will depend on the instructor."

Chinese contract law is integral to the functioning of the Chinese market economy and bears the influence of international contract norms. Yet, the conception of 'right to subrogation', the 'right to withdrawal' and the ambit of third party rights can be surprisingly extensive from the perspective of European private law. Property law will bear socialist overtones and communitarian concerns, even as private ownership and enterprise are promoted.

The term 'evidence' generally refers to that information by which disputed facts tend to be proved, and the Law of Evidence is that body of law and discretion regulating the means by which disputed facts may be proved in courts, tribunals and arbitration hearings in which the strict rules of evidence apply. The Law of Evidence therefore forms part of the adjectival law and operates in tandem with the law of criminal procedure and the law of civil procedure.

To this end, the Criminal Justice practices in the pre-trial, trial and post-trial stages of the Hong Kong Criminal Justice System will be considered and juxtaposed with Criminal Justice practices from past time periods and cultures, as well as contemporary practices in other jurisdictions. This is necessary because it is only once we know and understand the origins and development of the various mechanisms, stakeholders and institutions of our own Criminal Justice system, and are able to reflect on the similarities and differences it has with Criminal Justice Systems of other jurisdictions, that we can critically evaluate and comment on its efficiency, reliability, and scope for improvement.

The adoption of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and various other regulatory initiatives is reflective of this expectation. Against this background, this course aims to enable students to explore the evolution of business and human rights (BHR) as a specialised field, assess the relationship of BHR with other notions such as corporate social responsibility (CSR), and examine critically various regulatory initiatives that seek to promote socially responsible business conduct. BHR in this course is taken in a broad sense to include both legal and moral/ethical responsibilities of business in the areas of human rights, labour rights, and the environment. After providing background related to the intersection of business with human rights, students will be exposed to various BHR issues falling within the three broad sets of questions: why should business enterprises have human rights responsibilities; what is the nature and extent of these responsibilities; and how could human rights responsibilities be enforced against business enterprises and victims be provided effective remedies for corporate human rights abuses.\u00a0 \u00a0After completing this course, students should be able to discover why and how BHR policies should be integrated into day-to-day business decisions and how corporate executives could handle human rights dilemmas that arise during business operations.

        "courseDescription": "This course, which is jointly taught with Bar-Ilan University (Israel), takes a comparative approach to the examination of contract law theory and doctrine in Hong Kong and Israel. Hong Kong contract law is firmly rooted in the common law, while Israeli contract law may today be regarded within the civil law tradition. Even as Hong Kong law is strongly influenced by English law, its nuances and unique accents point to the need to examine the values and policies which underpin it. Israeli law, though strongly influenced by the continental jurisprudence, incorporates interesting elements of the common law tradition. By comparing Hong Kong law and Israeli law in selected areas of contract law, students obtain an appreciation of the different premises of a contract law regime located in different legal traditions, and new approaches to problem solving. Often, the differences in approach reveal a surprising similarity in outcomes. This prompts deeper inquiry into the values and policies which drive legal outcomes in any legal system.\u00a0\u00a0Assessment components are as follows:\u00a0\u2022 Group Presentation (70%) and\u00a0\u2022 Knowledge building/class contribution (30%).\u00a0For the group work, each group will consist of HK students and Israeli students. Each group gets to choose its research question; students will write up their research results as a group and present it to the class. Other students will have the chance to question, critique and comment on the research findings."
