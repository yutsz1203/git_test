It seeks to denaturalize notions such as family, marriage and love through contextualization--putting them back in the historical, political and socio-cultural context in which they are embedded. The questions that will be raised in class include: What factors shape the economic and social formations of intimate relationships in contemporary China? What does it mean to say that romantic love is an ideology? How do Chinese people “do” family today? Are intimate relationships formed in the virtual world any less authentic than those formed in the real world?The course approaches various kinds of intimate relationships through an anthropological lens, which means that we will explore people’s intimate life experiences via ethnography. Based on a series of captivating readings, video clips, discussions and other class activities, this course invites the students to pay attention to the interconnectedness between the “private” and the “public” -- the everyday practices and the economic and socio-political processes. Moreover, this course aims to show how to conduct ethnographic fieldwork and how to use the data collected during fieldwork for analyzing intimate relationships in Chinese society."
"Many 20th century Chinese films were concerned with issues of nationhood, identity and history.

"This course proposes a multi-disciplinary approach to the study of Chinese cultural history conceived of as a succession of modes of rationality (philosophical, bureaucratic, and economic processes of rationalization). The focus will be on the moments of paradigm shift from one mode of rationality to another. For each of these moments, cultural facts and artifacts—thought, literature, ritual—will be examined in relationship to changing social, political, and economic systems. The specific focus of this course is on the emergence of modern China in the Song-Yuan (960-1368) and of today’s China 1850 to the present. We will see how the modern attack on religion, redefined as ""superstition"", led not only to religious reform movements but also to a society in which science and the nation became the primary value systems promoted by the state."

"This course looks at the transformation of housing governance in urban China since the 1990s. The class will first introduce various perspectives to understand the role and importance of housing in general. It will then acquaint students with some basic policy analysis and evaluation skills. The following lectures will look at the Chinese context and investigate the structural change of China’s housing system and its impacts on urban society. By way of comparison, Hong Kong’s experience will be explored as well. Subsequently the course will cover a number of current housing policy issues in both mainland China and Hong Kong, such as development of affordable housing, real estate fever, protection of private property, and housing management. Particular attention will be paid to the interplay between changes in the housing sector and broader socio-political developments in contemporary China. Site visits will be conducted in Hong Kong and/or its neighbouring cities."
"More and more governments are taking actions to encourage social innovation with a view to leveraging resources in civil society to meet social needs. This course is designed to help students gain the knowledge of the “third sector” and civil society in the Chinese contexts (Mainland China and Hong Kong). In the course, we explore state-society relations by examining the roles of the third sector in public services, the development and governance of the third sector, and government actions to encourage social innovation and social entrepreneurship. The course also provides comparative analysis between the Chinese contexts and western liberal democracies with a view to highlighting how global trends on social economy (e.g., impact investing, social entrepreneurship) are adapted to Chinese contexts."
"Many 20th century Chinese films were mainly concerned with issues of nationhood, identity, trauma, and a national past. In recent years, however, while some directors have continued to focus on the nation, others have chosen to look at the present, as well as the effects of globalization on Chinese society, culture, and cinema production. This course asks that students begin to understand Chinese cinema(s) as transnational, a triangular composite of Mainland, Taiwan, and Hong Kong cinemas that has also been influenced by Japanese and Korean cinema. Students will be introduced to Chinese film history and criticism via an examination of thirteen films directed by several of Greater China's most skilled directors."
"Romance of the Three Kingdoms and The Outlaws of the Marsh, two masterpieces of classical Chinese fiction, are treasure troves of traditional Chinese values. This course will focus on the phenomenon of male bonding, an important facet of masculinity, as illustrated in these two works. Through a close study of major selections from the novels, their filmic adaptations, background materials and critical literature, students will come to understand the nature of close relationships between men in Chinese culture, observable in many social situations even today."
"This course aims to develop students' ability to acquire and manage interdisciplinary knowledge in relation to foreign direct investment (""FDI"") in China. The course will guide students to approach the topic from economic, historical, socio-cultural, legal and business angles. Student will be exposed to a wide spectrum of research materials that deal with FDI from the view point of a policy maker to a money-maker. Latest investment trend for private equity and venture capital, basic skills and processes for undertaking and managing direct investment in China will also be discussed."
"Since the mid-1980s China has witnessed the most sustained revival of interest in Confucianism (variously conceived as a form of culture, an ideology, and a tradition of morally normative values) of the past century. This revival has led to the proliferation of contending conceptions of the historical form and function of Confucianism, as well as proposals to rejuvenate Confucianism in order to make it a vital cultural and psycho-spiritual (jingshen) resource in the modern world. The course examines this remarkable revival of intellectual and popular interest in Confucianism in China over the past two decades."
"This course outlines the major regional differences in contemporary China, and their relations to China's global interactions,with a particular focus on the country's less developed western regions. It covers issues of Chinese foreign policy and international interactions, the nature of the economic and social transformations in the PRC over recent decades, and questions of particular relevance to western China such as levels of development, ethnic minorities and the sensitive regions of Tibet and Xinjiang. In conclusion, the course evaluates the future implications of the changing geography of China's political economy for its global relationships."
"This course examines issues of governance and regional integration in East Asia. Since the 1990s there has been a substantial increase in the number and scope of regional institutions covering both Southeast and Northeast Asia, and between the two regions. This course looks at how these developments have taken place and why, and at the implications for East Asia and beyond. It places examination of these institutions in the context of developments in global political economy, as well as examining the role in the region of large powers such as China; the continued importance of the nation-state in East Asia is one of the themes of the course. The course begins by placing the study of contemporary East Asia in its historical context, and outlining a number of theoretical concepts which are helpful in studying issues of regional formation."
"This course provides an overview of the development of media business in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan from the 1970s. Particular attention will be given to the response of media industries and media professionals to the challenges posed by commercialization, globalization, deregulation, and the new media. Students will also be exposed to the impact of differing cultural practices and regulatory regimes in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan over the management and operation of media businesses"
"This course will offer an overview of modern Chinese history by way of some of the traumatic events of the past eighty years. We will focus on seven such events: the Nanjing Massacre (1937), the 228 Incident (1947), the Anti-Rightist Movement (1957), the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), the June Fourth Incident (1989), the Hong Kong Handover (1997), and the Sichuan Earthquake (2008). These events represent different types of trauma: from the mostly “centripetal” trauma of 1937 to the “centrifugal” traumas of the Cultural Revolution and June Fourth, and from the unique “anticipatory” trauma of the Hong Kong Handover to the trauma caused by a natural disaster such as the Sichuan earthquake. Students will be asked to reflect on the way traumas are remembered, and to which use historical events are put in different contexts. Central themes of the course will be history and its representation, the function of memory and trauma in the construction of (national) identity, the moral issues involved in the representation of trauma, and the importance of remembering. The selected traumatic events will be approached by way of their representation in film and literature."
"In this course the connections between different cinemas within East Asia and between East Asia and the rest of the world will be explored from a genre perspective. Hong Kong and Korean crime movies, Chinese swordplay and Japanese samurai films, and horror films from Japan and Thailand: all are examples of the transnational circulation of genres, involving both processes of localization and globalization. The course will focus on three interrelated genres: the martial arts film, the Eastern Western and the crime film/film noir. Students will be invited to explore Hollywood-based genre theory, trace complex webs of creative influences, and appreciate the sameness and difference that characterizes both genre films and our globalizing world. They will also have a chance to apply this new knowledge in practice, by making a short “genre film” for screening at the end of the term."
"This course will seek to understand the implications of the transforming relations between the Chinese state and civil society on China’s political development. It will first examine the concept of civil society and discuss major issues in applying it in the Chinese context. The class will then investigate the transforming relations between the Chinese state and civil society by examining key issue areas of environmental, labour, and homeowner activism, popular protest, the online and traditional media, as well as the Chinese policy-making process. This course will also provide opportunities for students to have face-to-face exchange with leaders from various societal organizations in China."
"This course aims to provide students with a broader and deeper understanding of the increasingly intimate relationship between Hong Kong and Mainland China. The lecture topics are organized according to three dimensions of this liaison: political, economic and social. The lectures will introduce appropriate conceptual frameworks to understand this process and reflect on the meanings and practices of ""One Country Two Systems"". Students will be guided to debate relevant and contested public policies in class."
"This course explores the intersections of justice, law and morality in modern and contemporary China. The first half of the course engages the history of these interrelating elements in theory and practice from late imperial times through the Maoist and Post Mao era. The second half of the course invites students to explore and debate major problems of law, legal reform and justice in contemporary China."
"This course charts the trajectory of major political and economic policies since the late patriarch Deng Xiaoping kicked off the Era of Reform in the late 1970s. Efforts to liberalize Mao Zedong-style authoritarianism – and to introduce grassroots elections and other forms of democracy – will be examined. Also analyzed will be measures taken by the leaderships under ex-president Jiang Zemin and President Hu Jintao to introduce international norms to modernize the cadre system and the civil service. “Intra-party democracy” as well as reforms in the legal and judicial systems will be assessed. The evolution and significance of Beijing’s policies toward NGOs, dissidents, the media and the Internet will also be studied. This course also looks at reforms in the industrial, agricultural and financial sectors that have made possible China’s emergence as the world’s second largest economy. The “China model” – a mixed economy where state fiats coexist with market forces – will be analyzed. The comparative roles of state-owned enterprises, foreign direct investments and the fast-developing private sector will be examined. Also appraised will be whether Beijing is successful in turning the “world factory” into a “global innovation hub.” The course will conclude with a look at whether economic and political reforms undertaken by Beijing have satisfied the people’s aspirations – and helped render the country into a “responsible stakeholder” in the international order."
"This course aims at exploring the concept of diaspora in the Chinese context, as well as its evolvement and implications in a globalizing world.

"This course introduces the classic 18th-century novel, using edited extracts from the Penguin Classics translation by David Hawkes and John Minford. The work is studied as a culminating masterpiece in the long history of Chinese vernacular fiction, with special emphasis placed on the influence of the late-Ming novel Golden Lotus as a forerunner. The plot and structure of the novel are explained in some detail. Important themes in the novel are dealt with, its encyclopedic nature allowing a broad-ranging exploration of cultural and social issues in traditional China."
"What are democracies and autocracies? What are the key differences between the two? How to classify regimes? How to define China’s regime type? What are the main types of electoral systems in the world? How to classify China’s electoral process? What are the crucial features of bureaucracies, legislatures and political parties? What is “traditional” political activism? What are the new “repertoires” in China? To address these questions, this course will introduce students to the theories of comparative politics, focusing in particular on the situation in China. It will provide students with analytical skills from a global perspective, followed by in-depth discussion of contemporary China. This course will be structured in four parts including States and Regimes; Institutions; Actors; and Policies. Topics involve the nation state; democracy; variety of regimes; constitutions; electoral systems, bureaucracies; legislatures; political parties; interest groups and social movements; political culture; political activism; political communication; policy making processes and so forth. Each class will start with the introduction of relevant theories, followed by a comparative analysis of China in the second half."
"This seminar is designed as a survey of relations between China and selected Asian region states with primary focus on the post-1949 period. Initial sessions will focus on the origins and content of China’s policies toward the region. Varying assessments will be presented regarding China’s domestic and international policies, policy-making structures, and political and economic trends and capabilities. Later sessions will consider bi-lateral relations between China and major regional neighbors: Japan, Korea (both North and South), the ASEAN states, the Hong Kong SAR, and Taiwan. Region-wide themes such as human rights and religious freedom, inter-governmental and non-governmental organizations and integration, and China’s military development will be assessed within the context of China’s regional and global position."
"This course looks at the history and aesthetics of various arts in China (painting, calligraphy, photography, sculpture, architecture, installation, performance art, video or digital art, etc.), their role in Chinese culture, and in shaping the characteristics of Chinese art in the global context. The following themes will be dealt with: the aesthetic evaluation of these arts; their unique artistic features; the roles of the artist and the spectator in the context of globalization; the transformation of Chinese art from a perspective of cross-cultural exchange; the influence of Chinese art on the West; the aesthetic valuation of expressiveness and descriptiveness in art; and the cultural correlation between art and society. Historically, the course will cover the following areas: the artistic importance of the Lingnan School paintings in the late Qing dynasty (c.1850-1911), the evolution of Western and traditional painting in China (1911-1949), the art development during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), the cross-cultural exchange between Chinese art and Western art (1976-1989), and the question of “Chineseness” under the conditions of globalization and digitization (1989-now). We will deal with these topics by examining major works of art and by analyzing primary texts as well as contemporary scholarly writings."

We will cover the functions and roles of the earliest museum, as well as those of museums housing Chinese objects in the contemporary world. In addition to considering the display of Chinese artworks and artifacts in museums, we will also discuss the way museums are designed and positioned in their marketing strategies by making reference to their history and development. Finally, we will explore the interactions between China’s museums and those of its neighbors in Asia and the world. Topics covered in this course include terracotta in China and in Britain; Chinese trade arts in different media, such as silk, glass, porcelain and painting; visions of China in European and American museums; and contemporary Chinese art in a globalized world."
"This course will look at China’s changing political, economic and security relationships in Asia. It argues that these need to be understood in the context of the ongoing evolution and negotiation of Asian regional order and institutions in the aftermath of the Cold War, and that this Asian context (broadly defined) helps account for the objectives of and some apparent ambiguities and contradictions in Chinese foreign and security policy. The course will cover major theoretical approaches in International Relations and global political economy, and use these to evaluate China's relationships in Asia."
"This course looks at the history and aesthetics of Chinese painting and its role in Chinese culture, showing that art and life often are closely intertwined with each other. The following themes will be dealt with: the aesthetic evaluation of painting; the pictorial features unique in Chinese ink painting; the roles of the artist and the spectator; the aesthetic principles of Chinese painting; the cultural hierarchy of painting, poetry and calligraphy; the aesthetic valuation of expressiveness and descriptiveness in painting; and the cultural correlation between the quality of a painting and the virtue of the painter.

Besides discussing relevant literature about China’s international relations and its position in world history, students will be invited to analyse primary sources, such as newspaper articles, treaties, diaries, and visual sources."
"This course will discuss and analyse a complex juncture between politics and economy in 20th century China. The main goal of the course is to see how economic conditions affected and influenced political choices and decisions of the late-Qing, Republican and Communist regimes that governed Chinese people throughout a turbulent century of war and revolution. The most important questions we are going to discuss during the course are as follows: what were the living conditions of Chinese people and how can we study them? How did the economic situation of the country influence policy making and international relations? What was the human, environmental, social, and cultural cost of the economic programmes of the empire, and the Nationalist and Communist Party policies?"
"This course will examine key issues of urbanization and urbanity in light of Chinese experiences. Urban development in China since the economic reform has been transformative in its scale and pace of city-building and is a range of outcomes such as rapid economic development, growing income inequality, massive population mobility, and serious institutional challenges. After offering an overview of modern China's quest for urbanization since the late imperial era, this course will focus on the massive and rapid urbanizing process in the post-reform era. Students will be exposed to diverse issues, such as migration, population control, land policy, housing reform, urban planning, spatial reconfiguration, social welfare, inner-city poverty, infrastructure and transportation, environmental protection, and public space. The readings, drawn from multiple disciplines such as economics, sociology, anthropology, history, political science, and urban studies will examine the socioeconomic, political and cultural factors that contribute to the process and its particularities in the late-socialist context. This course will also seek to draw comparative lessons from China's experience to obtain a comparative understanding of the complex socioeconomic consequences and diverse patterns of urbanizing processes across the globe."

"Almost forty years after the death of Mao, China is still coming to grips with what historians now call the Mao era, from the founding of the People's Republic in 1949 to his death in 1976. The Mao era has had a profound impact on China's politics, economy, society, and culture; it is still being felt today. Examining both primary sources and recent scholarship on the Mao years, this course studies the waves of political movements and how they affected the lives of the Chinese people."
"In this course we are trying to make sense of potential threats that can lead to situations of national and human insecurity in China in the 21st century. The course begins with an introduction to the key theories and methodological approaches of the International Relations and Security Studies, before moving onto an exploration of an array of contemporary non-traditional security issues in the country. By the end of this course, you should have a more nuanced understanding of security threats in contemporary China and be able to use some of the theories in the discipline to explain why certain issues become threats and how political actors have sought to mitigate and resolve them."
