"This course helps students build up solid foundation in cell biology for their future research and studies in life sciences. Core modules of this course include: 1. Functions of technology and engineering in advancing understanding of cell; 2. Chemistry and physics of cell membrane and its mechanism of communications and transportation; 3. Endomembrane system and cytoskeleton in intracellular structuring and trafficking; and 4. Mechanisms of signal transduction in cell proliferation and programmed cell death. As the final capstone module of this course, the significance of cell biology in understanding and improving human health and disease will be discussed. Clinical researchers may be invited to share their innovative research design and findings and to inspire our students about the importance of basic discoveries in applied studies.Topics 1-8 introduce students our current understanding about the structures, functions and mechanisms of a number of components in a eukaryotic cell and illustrate how these components interact, leading to cell proliferation and programmed cell death. The final capstone topic “Clinical Application of Cell Biology” inspires the students about how they can apply what they have learned in the previous topics, seemingly fundamental and discrete, in an integrative manner for understanding and improving human health and diseases. This capstone topic will also stimulate the students to think out of the box and realize the significance of basic research in applied studies.Senior Student Mentorship Programme (SSMP) is implemented in this course so that the hundreds of students will be assigned into groups, mentoring by some selected senior students, who have taken this course before with good academic results. Besides sharing their learning experiences and answering their mentees’ questions about cell biology, these senior students, who are mostly engaging in experimental projects in their capstone courses, can also inspire their mentees about the innovation and design of their scientific studies. Clinical researchers are also invited to share their innovative research design and finding and to inspire our students about integration and application of some basic discoveries in cell biology for understanding and improving human health and diseases."
"This course provides students with an introduction to the general principles of ecology. The course covers four broad areas: behavioural ecology, population ecology, community ecology and ecosystem ecology. Behavioural ecology examines how behaviour contributes to survival and reproduction. The relationship between behaviour, ecology and evolution is emphasized. Population ecology concerns how populations grow and how they are limited by food, competition and predation. The community ecology component will focus on factors that determine the structure and function of biological communities, including nutrient cycles and biogeochemistry. The course will conclude with a module on ecosystem ecology discussing how ecosystem structure, function and services may be influenced by disturbances. Mathematical models will be used to illustrate the theoretical background for topics discussed."
