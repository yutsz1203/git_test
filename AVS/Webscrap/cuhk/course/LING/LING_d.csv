"This course invites students to explore the central components of human language, examining its structure and functions, how it is acquired, and how it changes over time. Students will have an overview of the grammatical properties of language, with respect to its sounds and sound system (phonetics and phonology), words and word formation (morphology), sentence patterns (syntax), and meaning (semantics). The course will highlight the psychological and biological foundations of language, and the applications of linguistics to other fields. Students will develop a basic understanding of language as a computational system that interacts with other cognitive systems of the human brain. The course will also discuss the social aspects of language and the computational processing of human language. Students will become more sensitive to their own use of language, and develop an appreciation of recent advances in linguistic science, with respect to universals and particulars of language, language and society, language variation and change, language acquisition, as well as language, mind and the brain."
