"Hospitality is about engaging people through friendly, genuine experiences. Today, the notion “hospitality” has gone beyond lodging and food & beverage businesses and been recognized as a key aspect of many other types of service businesses, e.g., tourism, retail, healthcare, recreation, or even real estate and property management services. Moreover, hospitality is not just about creating memorable, “front-of-the-stage” customer experiences. It is also about creating warm, welcoming, “back-of-the-stage” work experiences for employees. With “experience” as a central theme, a key question for organizations is “How to create the best experience for customers as well as employees?” This course prepares students to answer this question by applying Design Thinking methodology to hospitality experience design for customers and employees in service businesses. Design Thinking is a process for creatively and systematically solving problems by putting people and their needs first. It emphasizes deep understanding of user experience and empathetic, iterative, and non-linear processes of imagination and idea generation. In this course, students will learn about the fundamental design thinking processes and tools and apply them to practical projects aimed to incorporate the notion of hospitality in design thinking for hospitality and real estate businesses.

"The evidence-based policy and practice is of importance in real estate field. The best evidence, which can only be derived from an excellent research, is not only to enhance our understanding, but also to convince others. In the real estate practice, people may ask, “Does the household income affect the property price?” “Should a property located at higher floor command higher price?” The answer can be “yes” or “no” due to a number of factors affecting the price of a property. The empirical evidence is thus needed to convince others.This module focuses on quantitative methods in real estate.

"While branding has really only come of age in the last century, the idea of a brand as a mark of origin or trademark has a long history. The word itself derived from Old Norse and means “to burn” – as in literally burning a mark on property to signify ownership. On the most basic level a brand is still about a promise of consistency and a mark of value, but the role of branding is much more complex. Today, there is widespread recognition that brands are more than a logo that stimulates recognition and helps to identify a product or service. Instead we now appreciate that it is the emotional and intangible qualities that underpin the value of a brand. The hospitality sector has been quick to embrace “brand” in this regard recognizing that these qualities offer the greatest means of competitive advantage. Thus, to not only succeed but to thrive in a competitive landscape, hotels and other service brands in the wider hospitality sector, need to stand out by “standing for” something.

"Real estate, governing one-third of the world’s assets, plays an important role in the capital markets. It is thus crucial to understand how the real estate system works and what economic forces drive the real estate value. In the real estate system, there are two markets (space market and asset market) and one industry (development industry). Space market is essential to the overall real estate system as it governs rents. Changes in rent promptly influence the demand for real estate asset market, and development industry at a later date. This course introduces urban and real estate economics. Urban economics is the primary branch of economics for studying the space market. Topics related to urban economics and real estate space-market analysis will be covered, including four-quadrant model, central place theory, residual theory of land value, the concept of rent, bid-rent analysis, neighborhood life cycle, property life cycle, and demand and supply for real estate space market. After taking this course, students are expected to have in-depth understanding of factors that trigger the functioning of real estate space markets."
"The use of projects has been increasing in organizations. A project can be defined as a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result. Projects are particularly important for financial success of real estate and hospitality organizations, in which time-sensitive and budget-constrained projects are widely used in planning, developing, financing, evaluating, managing, and marketing business solutions or real estate properties. The abilities to successfully plan and execute projects have become an important leadership competency in the real estate and hospitality industries. To lead a larger organization in these industries, a manager needs to first develop the capabilities to integrate his or her technical, organizational, behavioral, financial, quality, logistical, and informational expertise in completing projects. The objective of this course is to equip students with project planning and execution skills and tools relevant to real estate and hospitality assets. In addition to discussing the critical steps in a project (e.g., initiation, plan, budget, schedule, monitoring, control, performance evaluation, and risk management), the course also emphasizes how organizational factors (structure, strategy, and culture) and industry-specific standards and practices affect project results. Experiential learning activities such as real-world group projects from the real estate/hospitality fields, active case discussions, and business examples will be offered along with lectures for the purpose of enhancing students’ conceptual understanding and practical skills."
"The objectives of this course are: (1) to supplement the study of theoretical perspectives with empirical research evidence, (2) to guide students in conducting empirical research, and (3) to nurture an academic mind and enable students to study the intimate relationship between theory and practice. Students will identify relevant industry issues and provide policy recommendations. These recommendations are grounded in academic literature and supported by empirical evidence. Students are expected to conduct a behavioral research project on an issue related to the hospitality and real estate industry."
"Real estate entities that construct, manage and hold real properties encounter various financial reporting issues that could affect their performance measurement. In real estate industry, the financial reporting is in fact unique and complex. While the industry has its own specific standards, it is mandatory that these entities also need to follow the statutory reporting requirements. This course covers the financial reporting practices adopted in the real estate industry and applies the financial statement analysis techniques in the performance measurement and valuation of real estate entities. Topics include fundamental accounting techniques and practices, relevant financial reporting standards for the real estate industry, subsequent measurement of investment property, as well as real estate financing and tax considerations. After taking this course, students are expected to have an in-depth understanding of the financial reporting standards required and be able to apply these standards in the valuation of real estate entities."

This course is designed to investigate and to discuss selected topics of current interests in the area of real estate.
"Experiential learning is a crucial element of real estate study. Since the real estate industry involves complex work practices and diverse professional fields, it is necessary for students to learn first-hand knowledge of real estate planning, development, management, and investment through site visits and field trips, local or overseas. This course is designed to extend students’ real estate learning beyond the classroom. The course combines classroom lectures / workshops on chosen real estate topics with a field trip to a location typically outside Hong Kong. Students are expected to apply theoretical concepts and tools to analyze real-world cases, conduct market research, and/or solve problems in a specific real estate area. The topics of this course will vary depending on different instructors, field trip locations, and project tasks."
"The real estate industry, which accounts for a significant portion of global capital assets, used to be known for relying on traditional practices and lacking capacity for continuous innovation. This, however, has changed in recent years with the fast development of property technology (PropTech) applications. PropTech refers to a wide range of technology-enabled solutions used to optimize all stages of the real estate process, from property design, construction, management to property buying, leasing, and selling. This course helps students understand how the Internet, mobile and digital technologies have changed residential and commercial real estate business operations. Students will learn to compare and evaluate PropTech solutions and understand the business opportunities and potential challenges associated with these new tools/platforms. Real-world cases and examples will be used to discuss the impact of PropTech on real estate practices."
"This course is designed to acquaint students with research and writings regarding the current issues in service industries. Students are made aware of the contemporary issues and are willing to think about his/her solutions in a logical sequence.
