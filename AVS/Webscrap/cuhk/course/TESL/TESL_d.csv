"This course covers the fundamental concepts related to (I) the TESOL curriculum and (II) English language teaching methodology. Part I aims to provide general coverage of important theories and issues concerning the curriculum with an emphasis on curricular design, implementation, and evaluation. Part II comprises an overview of various major language teaching methods as well as those specific to listening, reading, speaking, and writing. Students are expected to participate actively in teaching demonstrations in order to better grasp and reflect on the different approaches introduced."
"This course focuses on a number of contemporary theories and issues in second language acquisition (SLA) with the aim of preparing students for applications both in research and teaching. Topics will include, but are not limited to, internal factors, external factors, sociocultural aspects, cognition, metacognition, and learning strategies related to SLA. Recent research developments in the field in SLA will also be introduced for students to better understand practical applications of SLA theories. Students will be expected to read research articles in order to develop a solid foundation in SLA theories and their applications."
"This course introduces students to theoretical foundations and key concepts of second language assessment, such as reliability, validity, authenticity and washback. It examines basic principles of test design and evaluation and equips students with skills to construct, critique, adapt and score language tests, to conduct test item analysis, and to report and interpret test results. The course also discusses language assessment in relation to summative and formative assessment, assessment of, for and as learning, and alternative assessment, with specific reference to how assessment can be used to support classroom instruction. Students will be provided with opportunities for hands-on practice and to reflect critically on conventional assessment approaches in the light of best practices in language assessment."
"This course introduces research methods in TESOL with the goal of equipping students with the knowledge and skills to evaluate research in terms of appropriate research design, data collection instruments, and analytical procedures. The first part of the course discusses the major research traditions in TESOL, with a particular focus on classroom-based, practitioner research. The second part of the course examines a range of data collection techniques in relation to concepts such as internal/external reliability and validity. Authentic data will also be provided to students so that they can gain practical skills in qualitative and quantitative data analysis. Throughout the course, students will be expected to regularly read articles in academic journals with the aim of building an awareness of current research issues and developing their own research interests."
"This course provides an opportunity for students to explore a significant issue in TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) through undertaking an independent research project. Under the guidance of a supervisor, students will conceive, design and carry to completion the research study on an individual basis. They will survey relevant literature, formulate research questions, work out an appropriate methodological design, gather data, engage in critical data analysis, and report on the study in a dissertation of 8,000 to 10,000 words. Before embarking on the study, students will submit a research proposal that includes a literature review, research questions, methodology, and an implementation plan."
