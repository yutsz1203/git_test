"Hong Kong embodies the Common Law’s tradition, methods, rules, principles, and values. In this course, students will receive a solid grounding in the foundations and principal features of the Common Law as a legal system. Throughout the course, students will consider: (i) the extent to which the Common Law reflects and shapes the customs, traditions, and values of the societies it serves, with particular reference to Hong Kong society; (ii) the adaptability of the Common Law to serve different types of societies; and (iii) the role of the Common Law in underpinning civil and economic stability and liberty. Students will also develop their conceptual, research, and writing skills. Topics include: the historical origins of the Common Law in England; the reception of the Common Law; core values of the Common Law; stability and change – stare decisis, judicial reasoning, inductive versus deductive reasoning; ratio decidendi and obiter dicta; appeals; judicial independence; parliamentary supremacy; statutory interpretation; the independence of the legal profession; the legal academy; and evidence, juries and ‘the reasonable man.’ In relation to developing the students' appreciation of Common Law method, students will be given the opportunity to develop their own independent research, analysis, problem-solving, and writing skills for the study of law, using traditional paper and modern electronic resources.

"Legal analysis, research, and writing skills are essential for successful completion of your law degree and will equip you with many transferable skills for future study and professional life. You must learn how to analyse legal problems, research the relevant law and apply the law to the problems. This course is intended to provide an introduction to these skills which will be honed by your further legal studies and application of the skills.This course is very much “hands on”, as it will aid your learning by preparing answers to legal research problems. The problems may be from a variety of legal areas. By analysing these problems you will identify the legal issues that need to be researched. You will then be introduced to legal research resources, both paper and electronic, and guided through the research needed to provide a framework for your answers to the problems. The presentation of your answers is of the utmost importance. Lawyers must be effective communicators and have a command of language both written and oral. This course will introduce you to clear and effective presentation of your answers in writing and orally. For both writing and oral presentation you will learn how to structure, explain and support your legal analysis.Law differs from many other disciplines as you may be writing or presenting for many different audiences. Thus you may have to prepare answers to legal problems which are to be presented to your professors, a client, colleagues in a law firm, or in court. The skills required to prepare a summary of the relevant law for a busy partner in a firm are very different from those required for your legal essays as an undergraduate. You will also be taught how to make your presentation persuasive if appropriate. You will be encouraged to consider for whom you are researching and ensure that your writing and presentation is appropriate for your audience. You may be required to prepare the answers to these problems in written form, as short essays or legal memoranda, or orally, by way of short presentations before your peers or in a moot.The course will be taught by way of lectures and tutorials. In the lectures your professors will introduce legal problems to you and explain how they are analysed, how they are researched and how this research is then applied to the problem to prepare answers. In the tutorials you will provide the analysis, research and answers."

"This course is about the makeup and breakdown of the law of the sea treaty regime.In September 2013, the United States, a non-signatory of the UN Convention on Law of the Sea, signed the latest in a number of maritime boundary conventions, this time with Kiribati. And in March 2014, China, a signatory of the Convention, deflected a Filipino submission to the Permanent Court of Arbitration over claims to parts of the South China Sea. These not atypical developments suggest that the modern law of the sea regime — put into place by three conferences held in 1958, 1960, and 1973-1982 — may not be as necessary, or as effective, as its proponents had once believed. Codifying the law of the sea was a hugely ambitious project, pushing at sovereignty’s last frontier before outer space. First, it aimed to absorb customary law on the territorial sea, the continental shelf, the high seas, and fishing, into a treaty regime. Second, it articulated new international law concepts such as ‘exclusive economic zone’, ‘archipelagic state’, and transit passage through international straits. And finally, it offered a range of options for dispute resolution, which, provided states did not opt out of the regime, demanded that once a decision was handed down, states were bound to abide by them. Two issues have dominated the development of the regime: international security and the exploitation of resources. The powerful maritime states have sought the right of innocent passage through territorial waters and EEZs, and pushed for rights when traversing the high seas, archipelagos and straits. At the same time, the coastal states have laid claim to expanded territorial waters, contiguous zones, exclusive economic zones, and greater control over the resources within them. The concerns over security and resources have touched every component of the Convention, from the protection of the marine environment, to the conduct of scientific research. Some tensions have not been resolved, and the coming period may see the fraying, if not the unravelling, of the current arrangements."

Since ethical issues permeate the entire fabric of the law and the functioning of the legal system, this course will introduce law students to the fundamental principles of ethics and their relationship to moral and social problems before turning to a consideration of how these fundamental principles are understood and applied in addressing practical legal problems. The topics covered will include issues of professional conduct and related disciplinary proceedings."
"This course is a basic ‘how‐to’ course on transnational business transactions and essential for those wishing to understand cross‐border commercial practice. The course focuses on the legal issues faced by practising lawyers in the field, with particular emphasis on the basic legal steps involved in structuring trade and investment transactions. Issues such as trade terms, international sales of goods, documentary credits and the various forms of operating a business and multinational enterprise will be discussed at length.

This course will provide students with 1) a combination of knowledge and skills relating to the law and practice of banking; 2) an introduction to the banking regulatory regime in Hong Kong and how this works in practice; 3) an introduction to the interbank market and the law and practice of interbank transactions; and 4) an introduction to the law and practice of the banker -customer relationship, including: duties of confidentiality and principles of banking transactions."
"Hong Kong is a major centre for international transactions, not all of which go according to plan. Thus many cases proceeding in the Hong Kong courts and many arbitrations proceeding here will involve parties from many different jurisdictions. Equally, Hong Kong parties, having entered into international transactions, can find themselves subjected to the jurisdiction of the courts, or to the arbitral procedures, of other countries.This course is intended to give you an overview of the many issues to which international dispute resolution gives rise and the principles to be applied in the determination of those issues."
"This course will contrast the theory of criminal law / criminal process with the law in practice. The divergence between theory and practice will provide a springboard to encourage students to explore the nature of legal rules, the culture of criminal justice organizations, and how the socio-political context in which criminal law operates influences the treatment of various groups within the criminal process. In this course students will learn how to think critically about the operation of the criminal justice system. They will study the major aspects of the criminal process. Topics include: definitions and measurements of crime, the values and aims of the criminal justice system; police powers of arrest, search, detention and interrogation; the structure, organization and work practices of prosecutors and defence lawyers; guilty pleas and plea bargaining; the operation of prisons; and the effectiveness of non-custodial punishments. Course materials will draw heavily upon empirical research from Hong Kong and around the world."
"This course introduces students to the ways in which crime as a social phenomenon has been characterized, understood and responded to historically and in different societies. Students will examine a range of core issues in criminology including: the identification, definition and nature of crime; the emergence of modern criminology; theories about the aetiology of crime; youth justice; corporate fraud and crime; crime and misconduct in the professions; victimology; crime prevention; public safety and the management of risk; prisons and theories of punishment; and restorative justice."

Students will acquire a general knowledge of the criminal justice process of mainland China. They will review statutes, judicial interpretations, leading case decisions and academic commentary so that they will have a general understanding of the major principles, policies and institutions of Chinese criminal procedure. International and comparative sources, especially human rights treaties and international standards for criminal justice, will form an integral part in analysing the development of the Chinese system and the reform propositions designed to address problems in the existing system. Reference will be made throughout the course to empirical knowledge of the existing system, and students will consider the capacity of the system to adapt to change."
"In this course, students will explore the fundamental concepts, doctrines and methods of Chinese civil law. Students will learn about the general theory and concepts that underpin modern civil and commercial law in China and examine their application in selected areas of law. The course focuses on a comparative understanding of Chinese civil law in relation to Hong Kong common law and international commercial law and introduces critical insights into the civil law from a cross-disciplinary perspective. Students will use case studies to learn the method of civil law analysis case, and they will improve the essential skills of legal research, writing and presentation in the context of Chinese civil law. Topics include both the general doctrines of Chinese civil law (e.g., civil legal relationships, persons, things, civil juristic acts and prescription) and a selected number of particular areas of civil law (e.g., contracts, torts, unjust enrichment, real rights, personal rights and succession). This course serves as a foundation for the study of more specialized courses on Chinese civil and commercial law."
"This course will identify and deal with various aspects of personalty, our daily interaction with it, and its place in modern, commercial law. There are various ways of categorizing the personal property asset: these include as chattels real and personal, as chose in action and chose in possession, as tangibles and intangibles, and as future and present property. There are principles, common to all forms of personalty, which are used to identify the nature of the asset, the manner of the creation of interests, and the use of the asset as collateral for security or as quasi-security. The course will analyse how these traditional principles have been adapted to modern commercial law; how they can be used in the ""invention"" of novel interests and transactions; and how they can be adjusted to suit the variety of personal property assets. Topics will include: the principles common to both personalty and realty: the use of a chose in action as a commercial asset; the forms of personalty such as intellectual property rights, derivatives, shares, vehicles and equipment; the ability to use the physical state of chose in possession for sound security; and the recognition of the need for a valid,underlying contract when using an asset for commerce."
"This course will explore the business and legal issues arising from doing business in Hong Kong. We will consider the different issues that may arise during a typical lifecycle of a business, from the start-up stage to the general operations of a business, and to the options that are available upon cessation of a business. Much emphasis will be placed on looking at different issues from a practical and commercial perspective."
"In this course, students will learn about the laws and institutions in China that regulate commercial organizations, transactions and dispute resolution. They will explore the development of commercial law in China in the context of an evolving market economy, the integration of the Chinese legal framework with foreign and international commercial law in the era of economic globalization, and the role commercial regulation plays in China in business decision-making and social and economic governance. Students will be introduced to essential skills in Chinese commercial practice, such as legal research, legal drafting and alternative dispute resolution. Topics may include major areas of commercial law such as: commercial contracts, negotiable instruments; secured transactions; business organizations; securities regulation; consumer protection; competition law; banking, taxation; and commercial dispute resolution. Additional topics will be offered in other more specialized courses. This course serves both as a foundation for and complement to more specialized Chinese commercial law courses."
"In this course students will examine the political, economic, social, legal, and ideological contexts that create concepts of ‘family’ and that regulate family matters. Students will explore concepts of family, learn about the laws governing various types of ‘family’ relationships, and discuss the impact that the law has on family members when relationships break down. Students will also consider the adequacy of the law’s response to the problems of violence against family members in the home and consider procedures for the resolution of family disputes. Topics include marriage, divorce, custody, property arrangements on family breakdown, adoption, children’s rights, and dispute resolution."
"In this course, students will be given a general overview of the legal issues arising in and around the Internet. They will explore new developments arising in the digital age in the context of intellectual property principles, law as a value system, and the protection of property rights. They will gain a broad perspective and insights into the historical and cultural developments surrounding this relatively new and global area of the law and understand the impact of the Internet on different aspects of the law. They will also examine the law relating to defamation that is a part of the phenomenon of the Internet to enable them to develop a systematic understanding of its global impact. Topics include: intellectual property rights; domain name rights; digital copyright; carrier service provider liability; and the contractual and tortious issues that the internet has raised for users and providers at national and international levels."
"The protection of public health is one of the core responsibilities of government. In this course, students will: consider the various sources of risk to public health, which can include contagious diseases (e.g., SARS and AIDS), accidents at work, occupational diseases, contaminated food and clinical negligence; and explore what role the law does or might play in protecting and promoting public health. The course will adopt a comparative and contextual approach. Students will be introduced to the regulatory systems of other countries and encouraged to think creatively about the extent to which such systems could be adapted to improve the protection of public health in Hong Kong. The course will provide a springboard for students to interrogate wider health-related policy and ethical issues, such as the need to protect patient privacy, the potential for conflict between promoting public health and respect for medical ethics, and the value of private liability law in safeguarding public health."
"It is said that only two things in life are certain, death and taxes. The law of succession deals with the first of these, as society seeks to find rules of certainty and permanence so that the wishes of a deceased person can be respected. The law of succession is about who inherits what when someone dies and how society values and protects the wishes of a deceased person. It protects the interests of the beneficiaries under a will and those who inherit when a will is invalid or when there is no will. It sets out the rules on what makes a will 'valid' in law and the exact words that must be used. Its importance to the rule of law is incalculable in terms of certainty and predictability. In this course, students will learn the law of succession and explore the values inherent in the current system. Topics include: the Hong Kong rules governing the drafting and interpretation of a valid will; the revocation and operation of awill and the rules relating to testate and intestate inheritance; the role of the Executor and Administrator; and aspects of the rules relating to the Probate Registry in Hong Kong."
"On 26 August 1789, six weeks after Parisians had stormed the Bastille, the French National Assembly passed the Declaration of the Rights of Man – a momentous document that encapsulated the liberating principles of the Enlightenment. The very first article advanced the visionary idea that: ‘Men are born and remain free and equal in rights.’ This simple phrase asserted the supremacy of the rights of all human beings over the narrow privileges of an aristocratic elite. Henceforth, people would be defined — in theory, at least — by their common claim to freedom and equality, rather then by their allotted place in a God-given social hierarchy. Human rights had arrived.The fervour of the revolution soon abated, and, in the century and a half that followed, advances in rights took place in piecemeal fashion, mainly within the walls of the nation state. International campaigns emerged from time to time — but it was not until the Second World War that states felt compelled to develop a comprehensive international legal regime dealing with the rights of the individual. It was only then that the now-familiar global laws, treaties and tribunals devoted to upholding these rights, and punishing those who abuse them, began to take shape.This course focuses on the development of the international human rights regimes within public international law, and their impact on modern case law. Concentrating on the nine core treaties and the one core protocol, it covers the ‘political’ rights (such as the right to life, and the freedoms of expression and association); the ‘economic’ and ‘social’ rights (such as the rights to employment, education and leisure time); and some of the more recently codified rights (such as the rights of the child and of people with disabilities). Each session aims to situate international resolutions, treaties and protocols in their legal and political context, while also assessing their impact on contemporary cases drawn from jurisdictions around the world. In process, they will show that in this area of law, appearances are often deceptive, and issues are never black-and-white."
The purpose of this course is to provide a complete introduction to the subject of construction and the law in Hong Kong. It will consist of four main areas: 1) the construction process and the law with an introduction to the topic and its importance to the local economy; the parties engaged in the construction industry and their regulation; the forms of contract and procurement methods for construction services; 2) law in the context of construction contracts; 3) an overview of project finance and alternative forms of project delivery including public private partnerships; and 4) dispute resolution in the construction industry.
"This course is designed to give students the ability to analyze employment problems in the Hong Kong context. After completing the course, students should be able to identify relevant legal principles from the common law which apply to the employment relationship. In order to achieve this, students will need to develop an understanding of the role of the employer and the employee and the commercial realities which they face. Examples of topics include: (1) the question of employment status; (2) continuous employment; (3) wage regulations; (4) statutory entitlements to leave, severance payments, long service payments; (5) termination procedures; (6) common law duties owed by employers and employees; (7) Restrictive covenants; (8) the doctrine of vicarious liability."
"The European Union (EU), the North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA), the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), or even the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) now under negotiation between the United States and the EU are all Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs). PTAs, either in the form of a Free Trade Area (FTA) or in the form of a Customs Union (CU), aim to eliminate trade barriers among their parties. Accordingly, they are instruments of bilateral and regional economic integration. This course critically presents the law and policy of bilateral and regional economic integration in the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO)."
"Ensuring secure and reliable energy supply in a climate-friendly and socially responsible way is one of the most important challenges that most states around the world are facing today. These challenges are particularly acute in Hong Kong given the limited availability of natural resources and the high burden that energy production – in particular electricity generation – imposes on society. Law has a crucial role to play in the re-organization of energy supply towards more secure, cost efficient and sustainable patterns. In this context, energy law is becoming an increasingly important field of legal practice and research.This course examines the main principles of energy law from an international and comparative law perspective – with a specific interest for the legal challenges characterizing the organization of the Hong Kong and Chinese energy sector. The focus is on the liberalization of the HK and Chinese energy markets (i.e. opening of the energy markets to competition) and the de-carbonization of energy supply (i.e. the re-orientation of the energy system towards climate-friendly patterns). The objective of this course is to equip students with the necessary tools to apply the main concepts of energy law to concrete situations, e.g. the conclusion of energy contracts, access to the energy network infrastructure and the realization of energy investments."
"With continuing trends of declining fertility rates and increasing life expectancies, many advanced industrialised and industrialising countries are undergoing a seismic socio-demographic transformation. In our region, Hong Kong and the PRC are among the fastest ageing societies in the world. The number of senior citizens aged 65 and above in Hong Kong is predicted to rise from the current 1 million (13 per cent of total population) to 2.6 million (30 per cent of projected population) by 2041. Ageing issues have attracted growing attention across a wide range of public policy arenas such as the economy, labour market, pensions, taxation, health, social care, housing, environment and migration among other areas.This course provides students with a comprehensive overview of the legal issues most pertinent to the lives of older persons today. As societies around the world are confronted with rapidly ageing populations, many countries have adopted a range of legal and regulatory approaches to addressing issues such as age discrimination, in/capacity and old age, care of the elderly, elder abuse and exploitation, pensions and income maintenance, inheritance, among others. This course adopts an international and comparative approach to examine the legal issues and legal treatment of older people in ageing societies in Hong Kong, PRC, regionally, and globally. It introduces students to the demographic, social, economic, and cultural contexts within which the law and/or other forms of regulation respond to ageing issues in different societies."
"The course aims to develop students’ understanding of the fundamentals of PRC contract law. Students will be introduced to basic legal doctrines and core concepts, as well as statutory analysis of the main provisions of Contract Law 1999 (and to a lesser extent, the General Principles of the Civil Law) and relevant interpretations of the Supreme People’s Court. The course aims to enhance students’ ability to apply their knowledge of relevant legal principles and rules to analyse case problems. The course will further provide opportunities for students to compare and contrast PRC contract law with other common and civil law systems and transnational approaches such as the Convention on the International Sale of Goods and the UNIDROIT Principles on International Commercial Contracts."
"This course module will introduce and examine the system of international economic law (IEL). In so doing, it will provide students with foundation knowledge of the creation, architecture, structure and workings of IEL, namely international finance, trade and investment. While focused on the legal foundation, the course will place this in the wider context of economic, political and social context. Much of the course will be concentrated on the main global economic institutions – the so-called ‘Bretton Woods’ institutions – International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank and the World Trade Organization (WTO). The course will emphasise the construction of these institutions, the key concepts and overarching principles, how the institutions regulate State behaviour and how they enforce their rules through dispute settlement mechanisms.This course will provide the necessary context and background for students desiring to take further studies in IEL, such as focusing on WTO Law or International Investment Law. In the alternative, the course will provide a wider contextual base for those students who have already taken an IEL-related subject. In this regard, this course will situate existing knowledge in within the inter-connected IEL sphere."
"Tax considerations play an important role in many transactions and corporate decisions. They frequently affect the structure, location and nature of businesses, and the terms of commercial agreements, mergers and acquisitions. This course focuses on the basic principles of taxation and the practical tax issues that corporate and in-house lawyers in Hong Kong should be aware of when dealing with transactions and other corporate decisions.The course will cover the following topics:(a) Principles of taxation in Hong Kong and selected countries that have close economic ties with Hong Kong. (b) Practical tax considerations in business and investment decisions.(c) Tax compliance and enforcement issues.(d) Recent tax reforms and their practical implications.This course is suitable for all students. No mathematical skills are required."
"In this course, students will work in groups (of 3 to 5 students, depending on class size) to examine the relationship between the individual, the community and the law including identifying what constitutes a social problem, how social problems impact in practice on the individual, the wider community and the law’s relationship to solving real problems in society. Students are encouraged to apply their legal knowledge in developing socio-legal research projects in conjunction with and for the benefit of selected groups such as school children, domestic workers, defendants in criminal cases, minority groups in Hong Kong, prisoners and unrepresented litigants. Students will be introduced to quantitative and qualitative research methods and the ethics of undertaking research. Through completing a research proposal, students will develop an appreciation of the role of socio-legal research in exposing the strengths, weakness and limitations of the law. Students will acquire practical experience in engaging with their classmates and members of the wider community. Through working in groups to critically examine a socio-legal problem, it is envisaged that students will gain an insight into the construction of social problems, the context of law in society, and understanding of the role of law in a practical sense. The research proposals produced in this course will serve as a springboard to future courses such as the independent research paper or legal clinical courses where students can take their proposals and subsequently implement them in these courses. In other words, students may choose to carry out the socio-legal research project and submit it as their independent research paper (LAWS4010). Student groups will also have to submit a brief outline of some solution that would help to meet any need for legal advice that the groups that they have studied may have."
"This course aims to provide undergraduate students with the relevant principles of international and national laws that affect aviation, and to introduce the student to an interdisciplinary analysis of the business and legal issues confronting airlines."
"This course provides a basic introduction to the field of law and literature, focusing on the interdisciplinary connection between both. It is designed to examine the role of storytelling in law, and the role of law, legal reasoning, and legal institutions in literary works.It examines two commonly-discussed sub-fields: “law-in-literature” and “law-as-literature”. Law-in-literature focuses on the depiction of law and jurisprudential issues in works of literature. It aims at exploring questions such as what insights works of literature can contribute to the study of law and in what ways literature enhances our understanding of the law. Law-as-literature examines legal opinions, arguments, and concepts through a literary lens – as works or elements of literature – exploring the similarities law shares with literature and focusing on the construction of narratives by lawyers, judges, and other legal actors to advance our understanding of the law.You will also be invited to go beyond considerations of law and literature to consider law’s relationship to culture and society as a whole. This course will provide you with an opportunity to think about the law in a new way and to participate in an interdisciplinary discussion of the larger questions of law and life.In each class, we will explore one or more interrelated topics through a variety of literary and legal works of short to moderate length. Readings will include judicial opinions by judges in different jurisdictions and literary works by writers across cultures."
"This course aims to introduce and familiarize students with the laws and legal system of the United States. As a common law jurisdiction and the largest economy in the world, the United States exerts a great deal of influence in Hong Kong and in Greater China. The U.S. Supreme Court is frequently cited around the world, including by Hong Kong courts, and American law often serves as the basis for resolving international legal disputes. Students in this course will develop a broad knowledge and understanding of the U.S. Constitution, the structure of American government, the criminal and civil justice systems, and the legal profession. This knowledge will serve them well in international legal practice and in any further studies they may pursue in the United States. By learning about another, and rather unique, common law system, students in this course will also gain a better understanding of the Hong Kong legal system, and of common law legal reasoning."
"This course will:• Provide a broad introduction to the future of the legal profession in times when legal technologies are rapidly gaining importance;• Discuss the different forms of legal technologies;• Explore the actual and potential impact of legal technologies on legal systems, concepts and rules;• Consider the application of legal technologies in particular areas of law;• Analyse and critique the impact of legal technologies, including advantages and risks, on legal systems and the society as a whole."
"Legal actors, institutions, and problems have fascinated filmmakers since the early days of cinema. This course examines the ways in which the law and the legal system have been represented in a variety of films, and also considers the ways in which films engage with legal debates and controversies. It aims to encourage reflection on the cultural lives of the law and also on a central theme in film studies. The course is organised thematically and analyses film and legal process from a variety of jurisdictions across the globe. It explores how key legal issues, procedures, and actors are represented on film and how these representations in popular culture in turn influence understandings of the law, and in certain circumstances even its development. In particular, the module will focus on the genre of documentary film because of its commitment to authenticity and investigation of reality, while giving the students the freedom to explore feature films, TV series, and podcasts."
"The course introduces students to current applications of Artificial Intelligence in law and business in a thought-provoking way and encourages students to develop a broad and multifaceted philosophy of how AI, law and society co-exist. The course looks principally at two issues- what is the law of the future? And, what is the future of law?In addition, the course looks at the impact of Artificial Intelligence in specific areas of law, including contract, criminal, finance, intellectual property and torts."
"Prerequisites: Completion of LAWS1041 Contract I.China has been a CISG Contracting State since the entering into force of the CISG on 1 January 1988. The CISG has (officially) become effective also in Hong Kong as of 1 December 2022. Many trading partners of mainland and Hong Kong parties are located in CISG Contracting States potentially triggering the applicability of the CISG according to its Art. 1 for related sales contracts. The importance of the CISG for Mainland China, Hong Kong and the entire Greater China region is therefore immense. This course equips students with a sound understanding of the CISG and its theoretical and practical implications thus preparing them for legal work related to international trade."
"Chinese private international law is instrumental in dispute resolutions relating to China, one of the key economic powers of the world. As such, it is beneficial for everyone interested in doing business with China to learn these important private international law rules. This is particularly the case for lawyers in Hong Kong who deal with Chinese legal matters on a daily basis. Due to the large number of private international law topics, the course will focus mainly on the conflict rules relating to international business transactions."
"Hong Kong is a small but highly international jurisdiction. Many legal disputes between private parties in Hong Kong involve legal rules, principles and issues from elsewhere in China or abroad. These other laws are frequently inconsistent with the law in Hong Kong. For instance, a contract concluded between a Hong Kong company and a US company in Japan may contain clauses that are enforceable in Japanese law but not in Hong Kong. In this course, students will study the rules and principles that exist for resolving conflicts that arise between Hong Kong law and the law of other jurisdictions. The rules of Private International Law (sometimes known as Conflict of Laws) are orientated to answering three questions: 1) Which law applies in the event of a conflict? 2) Do Hong Kong courts have jurisdiction to determine the dispute, and should they exercise jurisdiction? 3) Should a HongKong court recognize and enforce a foreign court's judgment? These questions are examined in a few selected areas such as contracts, torts, family law, criminal law and property."
"Students will critically reflect upon the commonalities and distinctions between the legal systems of Hong Kong and England & Wales, including (but not limited to) the operation of the courts, the structure of the professions, developing jurisprudence, and legal education.This course serves as the capstone LLB course and only eligible for students participating in the CUHK-KCL LLB-LLM Study Option.Students will submit four reflective blogposts (approx. 1000 words each) to the course leader over the course of the academic year in which they are attending KCL. The exact schedule of submission can be arranged by the course leader, but should follow a rough ‘one post per two month’ pattern. After review and approval by the course leader, the posts will appear on a publicly-accessible subsite of the CUHK Law webpage highlighting our students’ participation in this innovative LLB-LLM programme. Each post will be graded on a pass/fail basis. Students must successfully complete all four posts to pass the course. Students may also propose substitutions for written posts, provided that the overall content is aligned with the goals of the course and is in a format that it can in some way be published on the CUHK Faculty of Law website (eg a video). Any such substitution must be approved in advance by the course leader."
"It would be beneficial if students have successfully completed LAWS4151 Equity and Trusts I, LAWS4152 Equity and Trusts II, LAWS3151 Land Law I and LAWS3152 Land Law II.In this course, students will study the acquisition, use, and limitations of property. Students will have an opportunity to gain an understanding of the fundamentals of property law including what property is, how it is created, acquired, transferred and may come to an end. The course will consider property rights as already studied with regard to the law of trusts and land law, and will build on this understanding to provide students with an overview of the law of property and property rights , and a focus on specific property law areas which are important and, in certain instances, specific to Hong Kong."
"The purpose of this course is to give students the opportunity to formulate their own research question in an area of law related study in which they have an interest, and to answer this question by conducting independent research with support from an academic assessor. Through this process, the student will produce a 7,000 – 7,500 word research paper. The paper should represent an independent analytical inquiry rather than a merely descriptive review. Students will be free to select their own area of research subject to approval by the course leader and academic assessor."
"Commercial law involves different types of business relationships and interrelated financial transactions. In this course, students will be introduced to specific commercial transactions and the legal issues related to them. Students will develop their problem-solving skills by analysing these relationships and by examining typical commercial situations in the commercial context. Topics covered will include: the Sale of Goods Ordinance; personal property and interests in personal property; credit and security, including pledges, liens, mortgages, charges and guarantees; nemo dat and exceptions; the provisions of the Hong Kong consumer protection statutes (e.g. the Moneylenders Ordinance and the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance)."
"The prerequisites for this course are LAWS3151 Land Law I and LAWS3152 Land Law II.This course is designed to provide a foundation for Conveyancing practice. This course builds upon LAWS3151 Land Law I and LAWS3152 Land Law II by way of an overview of the Hong Kong land tenure system and conveyancing practice. In particular, it will examine issues in relation to the nature of interests granted, the ownerships of units in multi-storey buildings, the management of multi-storey buildings and the terms and conditions under which land is held and transferred. Students will be introduced to typical sale and purchase agreements, other conveyancing documents, the law relating to proof of title, and remedies for breath of contract."
"As the Common Law developed and matured over centuries, its rules and principles assumed progressively more definite shape, sometimes to the point of rigidity. Individual cases increasingly occurred in which it became impossible to apply the relatively strict requirements of the Common Law while simultaneously achieving a result which accorded with basic requirements of justice. The response of the English legal system was to accommodate a parallel system of courts whose task was, in appropriate circumstances, to temper the application of the Common Law with principles derived from elementary considerations of fairness – or equity. Among the more important contributions of equity is the trust, which enables a person to acquire an enforceable interest in something when another person is the legal owner. The flexibility of equity and the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery also allowed equity to develop a series of remedies which were far more powerful than the common law: amongst these the injunction, specific performance, equitable account and the doctrine of subrogation are very important today in a commercial context. Throughout the course students will learn to evaluate the part played by equity and trusts in: (1) accommodating the law to elementary requirements of justice and fairness; and (2) the suitability of that accommodation to the social, economic, and historical circumstances of Hong Kong. In this course students will develop their problem-solving, research, and writing skills. Topics include: the history and nature of equity; the relationship between the Common Law and equity; the nature and types of trusts; the creation of trusts; trust anomalies; assignments and disposition of equitable interests; and remedies."
"This module builds on the understanding of equity and trusts developed in LAWS4151.Equity and Trusts II will consider the development of fiduciary obligations and the use of equitable principles to deal with wrongdoing by fiduciaries.As the law of trusts developed the rights, duties and liabilities of the actors in trust relationships have changed, especially the role of trustee, which may now require a degree of professionalism and business acumen when dealing with protecting the trust fund and administering beneficiaries’ interests. The importance of the wishes of the person who creates the trust, the settler or testator, has also changed as the Court has been willing to vary the terms of the trust in various circumstances. Apart from trusts, Equity has also provided modern commerce with the basis of professional relationships: the fiduciary. The company director owes a fiduciary duty to the company and the remedies available to the company for his wrongdoings are equitable. Similarly professional duties of confidentiality are based on fiduciary principles. Over the centuries, whereas the common law was restricted to the remedy of damages, Equity developed a series of flexible and powerful remedies, such as: subpoena; equitable account; subrogation; and rescission. Foremost amongst these was the injunction, which can be used to stop someone doing something or make them do it. Equity also developed flexible principles for tracing misappropriated property into the hands of the wrongdoer and third parties. Throughout the course students will learn to evaluate the part played by equity and trusts in: (1) accommodating the law to elementary requirements of justice and fairness; and (2) the suitability of that accommodation to the social, economic, and historical circumstances of Hong Kong. In this course students will develop their problem-solving, research, and writing skills.Topics include: duties in trust relationships; powers of trustees; remedies for breach of trust; variation of trusts; trusts of the family home; tracing; and the liability of strangers to the trust."
"Public International Law is the body of rules and principles regulating primarily the conduct of relations among States (i.e. independent countries) and intergovernmental organizations(e.g., the United Nations). It is the legal framework within which international life at the official level is conducted; it aims to facilitate an orderly, just and peaceful system of international politics. Students enrolled in this course will learn about the international legal architecture, develop an appreciation of the role of international law, and understand the impact of globalization on international law. Topics may include: the history and nature of international law; the sources of international law; treaties; statehood and international legal personality; state responsibility; the treatment of foreign nationals and diplomatic protection; state jurisdiction; state immunities; state territory; international dispute settlement; the use of force in international relations; the law of the sea; and international human rights. This course serves as a foundation for more advanced studies in particular specialized fields of international law."
"In times of internationalization and globalization 'pure' legal systems are on the verge of disappearing. In contrast almost all legal systems are to a certain extent 'mixed' or 'mixing' (i.e. have incorporated or are incorporating legal structures that have been developed in other legal systems). Internationalization and globalization also lead to increasing numbers of cross-border activities requiring the concerned parties to consider multi-jurisdictional issues. Consequently, comparative legal work is gaining in importance. This course is designed to give credit to the growing practical significance of comparative legal work. Students will examine the meaning and the instrumentality of comparative law, explore how various systems are adapting to change, and critically analyse traditional concepts. They will also appreciate the insights that adopting a comparative law approach brings while developing new perspectives in this area. Topics include: the concept of comparative law and its significance in practice; the methods and history of comparative law; the (traditional) euro-centric approach of comparative law; the (traditional) private law-centered approach of comparative law; mixed and harmonized legal systems; and a comparison of major private law concepts, major constitutional and administrative law concepts and major criminal law concepts"
"International Criminal Law is a branch of public international law that deals specifically with the rules and principles establishing international crimes and the institutional machinery for dealing with them. An ‘international crime’ is an ‘act universally recognized as criminal, which is considered a grave matter of international concern and for some valid reason cannot be left within the exclusive jurisdiction of the State that would have control over it under ordinary circumstances’ (US Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, Hostages Trial, 1948). Students enrolled in this course will examine substantive and procedural international criminal law as well as broader notions of transitional justice and the effectiveness of post-conflict international criminal justice mechanisms. Topics include: the history and nature of international criminal law; international crimes such as genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and aggression; modes of responsibility such as command responsibility and joint criminal enterprise; defences such as duress; international courts and tribunals such as the International Criminal Court and the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia; selected procedures such as those relating to victim participation and reparations; and the rights of the accused."

Where relevant, cross-border environmental issues and international environmental law are examined."
"This course studies key aspects of environmental law in China. It examines major environmental legal concepts and mechanisms, explores fundamental environmental legal principles, and evaluates the operation of environmental law in action. The course enables students to acquire an appreciation of the socio-economic and political context for the development of the environmental legal regime in mainland China. In addition to analysing the traditional command-and-control regulatory schemes that tackle the problems of air pollution, water pollution and waste disposal, and prevention-oriented environmental impact assessment regime, the course investigates the roles of courts and NGOs in protecting the environment. Where relevant, cross-border environmental issues and international environmental law are examined."
"The law operates to constrain the use and development of land in various ways. Many of these constraints emanate from the operation of private law, namely the law of real property and the law of contract. However, the most fundamental and wide-ranging constraints are imposed by the state through the operation of the planning system. Planning law is a branch of public law that is concerned with the regulation of land development in the public interest. It provides the forum for resolving disputes between those who wish to develop land and those who want to ensure that such development does not harm the environment or destroy public amenity. In this course, students will learn to identify the problems/conflicts engendered by land development and to evaluate potential methods of resolution or management. It is against this backdrop that students will also explore the origins, development and rationale of the planning system in Hong Kong, as well as receiving a comprehensive education in the detailed rules and regulations which currently govern development of land. Topics include: public participation in planning; the plan making process; development control; protection of areas and interests of special importance; and the resolution of planning disputes."
"In this course students will examine the principles underlying the group of causes of action which has become known as intellectual property. Intellectual property comprises registered and unregistered trademarks (passing off), domain names, copyright, patents, designs, trade secrets, plant varieties, and silicon chip topography. Students will gain a critical understanding of these areas of the law, some historically formed others recent sui generis regimes, and their place in modern society. Students will also develop their problem-solving and legal research, writing, and presentation skills. The course will adopt a contextual approach placing the study of intellectual property within the history and culture of Hong Kong society so that students gain a broader understanding of the role of intellectual property in Hong Kong. Topics include major international treaties such as World Trade Organisation (WTO) Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) Agreement, Paris, Berne and other major conventions, and the causes of action listed above."
"International (bilateral and multilateral) trade systems have become increasingly important over the past three decades. In this course students will analyze the reasons for the emergence of international trade organizations, their significance for the world’s economies, their structural differences, their functioning, and their problems. Students enrolled in this course will obtain a critical understanding of historical, current, and future developments of the WTO and its importance for Hong Kong and the greater China region. They will also acquire the skills that are necessary to conduct independent research in the area of WTO-law and to give advice on related practical aspects from the viewpoint of international organizations, national governments, industry associations, and private enterprise.

"The mid-twentieth century saw a convergence in and standardization of transnational tradeand economic law with supra-national multinational companies creating their own framework for economic growth. The role of major international organizations such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund have established the 'Washington Consensus' in international trade, finance and economics while the impact of multinational companies on developing nations cannot be over-estimated. In this course, students will explore the cultural, social and legal dimensions of this supranational trade and economic law. They will consider how national governments have responded to the demands of the international investor and the 'global ethics of business'. Students will also examine and evaluate the role of international trade organizations, such as the World Bank and the WTO, and the underlying value system that must now be adopted by all developing nations in order to participate in global capitalism. Students will be required to read extensively and to develop a critical understanding of the interrelationship of law, economic development, and the Washington Consensus on the rule of law as the dominant discourse of the twenty-first century."
"Insurance law is a specialized branch of contract law. A contract will establish rights and obligations of insurance when it transfers the financial risk of a specified event from the party who would normally bear the risk to one or more other parties. Insurance contracts are often critically important in business because they give parties greater assurance, thereby encouraging more adventurous risk-taking and a more dynamic economy. They are also valuable in daily life by giving reassurance that death, accidents or illness need not prove financially ruinous to individuals and families. In this course, students will examine the special rules and principles that have emerged to regulate contracts of insurance. Throughout the course, students will consider the impact of insurance law on the economic and social life of the community. Topics include: the nature of insurance, and insurance as contract; types of insurance (e.g., life, motor vehicle, fire, casualty, marine, health and disability, liability, title); the insurance proposal; the obligation of utmost good faith and disclosure; indemnity and non-indemnity contracts; insurable interest; the definition of risk; persons insured; insurer's defences; limits of liability; subrogation; and third-party rights."
"Since much of the legitimacy of government is predicated on revenue raised from the public purse, taxation is a public policy issue. Students enrolled in this course will explore the rules and principles regulating the taxation of incomes, profits and property in Hong Kong in the context of competing notions concerning wealth creation and social justice. Since revenue law is mostly legislation-based, students will acquire a good understanding of the InlandRevenue Ordinance and other relevant legislation as illuminated by case law. The course will include an overview of the practical application of the law by the Inland Revenue Department and an assessment of the public policy considerations upon which Hong Kong's revenue-collection system is based."
"Tax law often plays a very significant role when it comes to making business decisions in all jurisdictions including Mainland China. Students will acquire an in-depth understanding of the Chinese tax system. They will come to understand the historical development of the Chinese tax regimes and the political, cultural, economic, and social factors that have shaped and continue to shape the enactment and the implementation of related rules in practice. The course begins with a general discussion of tax concepts and their meaning for Mainland China in general. Thereafter students will consider how the Chinese tax system has developed over the years, focusing on its contours and its problems. The course primarily focuses on the rules governing the most important Chinese tax types, namely individual income tax, income tax imposed on enterprises with and without foreign investment, value-added tax, business tax and consumption tax (as well as environmental taxes of expanded scope). During the course, students will learn about the current discussion to reform the PRC tax system and the potential significance of these reforms for the different concerned parties. Throughout the course students will develop their problem-solving, legal research, writing, and presentation skills to an appropriate undergraduate level."

"This course considers the historical origins of the modern corporation, how corporate prosecutions developed, and the various types of corporate crime. It examines the cost and extent of corporate crime, and theories of how and why it happens. The course covers some common law and UK legislative responses to particular types of crime – such as corporate manslaughter - and the theories and practice of corporate punishment. The course also explores the advent of the theory and practice of ‘corporate social responsibility’, how businesses are expected to conduct their operations internationally with responsibility and accountability to their stakeholders and to wider society. It examines how this expectation is framed in terms of human rights obligations. Students with an interest in corporate behaviour, crime, law and ethics will find this course useful. Students must have taken courses in at least one of the following areas, at CUHK or otherinstitutions, prior to enrolling for this course: Human Rights Law (including LAWS3370), PRC Legal System (including LAWS2030 (or LAWS 1030 taken in 2008-09 or before)), Constitutional Law (including LAWS2100), Criminal Law (including LAWS2121 or LAWS2122)."
"The Law and Liberal Studies Course will be offered by the Faculty as a Fourth year LLB Elective to allow students to reflect on and develop their critical thinking, presentation and research skills in the teaching of Hong Kong legal issues in Liberal Studies in secondary schools in Hong Kong. The Course will allow students the opportunity to explore and research further into those aspects of Hong Kong law that they have already studied as part of the LLB curriculum. Students will teach from materials based upon the Faculty’s archive of ‘The Individual, The Community and The Law’ research projects. Students will therefore build on and consolidate their knowledge, skills, values and attitudes as they explore these issues in depth. This Course will also provide a significant theoretical and applied learning experience for Final Year law students preparing for the workplace as they develop their presentation and organisational skills through self-directed learning on topics of major substantive knowledge gained though the study of law. Final Year law students selected for this course will teach Law and Liberal Studies classes as part of the Liberal Studies Curriculum in Secondary Schools. In addition law students will be required to attend Faculty of Law Seminars on The Teaching of Law as Liberal Studies and to submit a 4000 word reflective essay on Teaching Law as Liberal Studies at the end of the Course. The Course Leader will co-ordinate with the teachers in the Secondary Schools to ensure standards and to evaluate the law students’ performance. The law students selected for this Course will be known as The Sir TL Yang Teaching Fellows for the purposes of this Course and will be expected to conduct themselves accordingly in all dealings with the Secondary Schools and pupils."
"International Sales Disputes is an ideal course for students aiming to develop their knowledge of a core field of transnational commercial law. Students will consider key legal issues concerning both the avoidance and the resolution of international sales disputes in theory and practice. The course will further introduce students to the United Nations CISG Convention, which is applicable in over 70 countries worldwide and accounts for two thirds of global trade. The specific topic areas will allow students to explore and critically assess, in particular, the primary substantive rules, the impact on the CISG of modern ‘soft law’ principles and the future of the Convention."
"This course will examine the general rules on competition applicable to Hong Kong. The Competition Ordinance, Hong Kong’s first ever cross-sector competition law, was passed in June 2012. In its application, the newly established Hong Kong competition authorities will draw from International experience. This course thus explores the principles common to the main competition regimes around the world which have influenced the drafting of the law in Hong Kong (mainly the EU and US, but also Mainland China), so as to understand how the new rules will work in practice. By way of introduction to the course the theories of competition law and the objectives of competition law will be examined, as well as the basic procedural rules. The substantive topics considered will include collusion, abuse of dominance and merger control."
"Individuals – willingly or otherwise – tend to generate significant amounts of information in the course of their daily lives. This information can be processed by both state and non-state actors to generate profiles that may help predict future behaviour. While such categorization may in some circumstances be benign or even desired by the subject, if the information processing is unwanted or unknown it may implicate individual autonomy in important ways. This course will consider the normative values that may be threatened by various kinds of information gathering and processing, and consider what legal protections – if any – may be appropriate. Students will be exposed to the regulatory regimes and legal frameworks that govern the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information in both Hong Kong and in other jurisdictions. We will consider laws and policies that apply to both the private and the public sectors, and the ways in which they differ. Students will be encouraged to reflect upon different philosophical accounts of privacy, and consider which one is best reflected by the Hong Kong legal system. Students will consider how best privacy can (or should) be balanced off against commercial or government interests in the personal information of individuals. Thematic topics will include (but will not be limited to) the surveillance of public space for commercial purposes, privacy and online social networks, the coming rise of ‘wearable’ computing, the warrantless collection of ‘metadata’ by the state, and the privacy implications of cloud computing. This course incorporates an extended range of mandatory readings and students will be expected to extensively participate orally in the classroom. A research paper on a related topic of the student’s choosing will be the primary form of assessment."
"In recent years the term “cultural heritage” has been used in many domestic laws, international agreements, conventions, treaties and academic works to refer indiscriminately to art and antiquities. This course considers the meaning of the terms “art”, “antiquities” and “cultural heritage” and the legal frameworks which affect them in Hong Kong and internationally. The course begins by considering the use of these terms and the distinct and overlapping laws which affect them. The course continues considering the issues affecting the ownership, transfer and protection of art, antiquities and cultural heritage in Hong Kong The rise of the art and antiquities market in China will be considered and the unusual position of Hong Kong as a market for Chinese artifacts in the legitimate and illicit global trade in art and antiques and its position in the illicit trade will also be considered. The issues of illicit trafficking of art, antiquities and cultural heritage will be considered and the use of art, antiquities and cultural heritage for money laundering and the financing of terror. The course will consider issues of repatriation of cultural property from private and public collections, for example the looting of the Summer Palace in Beijing. Recent issues involving the protection of heritage in armed conflict and the political value in protecting and/or destroying art, antiquities and cultural heritage will also be considered."

The course is designed to be interactive and students are expected to actively contribute to class discussions and will be assessed on their in-class participation."
"This course compares the private international law rules of Hong Kong, the European Union, the United States, and China. It examines the different approaches of the said jurisdictions in dealing with the three major questions of private international law, namely jurisdiction, choice of law and enforcement of foreign judgment. Due to the number of jurisdictions covered in the course, the course will focus mainly on the conflict rules relating to international business transactions."
"This course is about life and death – about the ability of mankind to restrain its environmental impact in order to make the existence of future generations possible. The International Geological Congress agreed in August 2016 that we had entered the Anthropocene – a new geological age where human influence has a distinct impact on most planetary systems. Greenhouse gas emissions from human activities have already caused an increase in global average temperature by 0.8 degrees Celsius and a raise of sea-level by 20 centimeters, triggering slow but dramatic planetary-wide adjustments. Efforts have been made to try to mitigate the disaster. Several treaties have been adopted since 1992. Under the US-China Joint Announcement of 2014 and the Paris Agreement of 2015, the world’s greatest economic actors agreed to accelerate and increase domestic measures. Substantial investments are being made to induce a global transition to “green” economy, with China progressively taking the lead. Hong Kong is bound by several treaties ratified by China. Hong Kong’s Climate Change Strategy and Action Agenda was adopted in 2010 and is being implemented through laws and policies in multiple sectors. Responses to climate change are increasingly impacting all aspects of the law, domestically and internationally. But is this sufficient? Will we, as a civilization and as a species, survive our entry in the Anthropocene?"
"The course is a clinical and theoretical immersion into legal aspects of entrepreneurship, with a focus on the formation and operation of a startup company. Students will be chosen for the NVLT on a competitive basis and may remain engaged in the Team throughout their period of study, although they will be assessed for only one term of such engagement, as discussed below.Students will learn through active, “clinical” or “moot” engagement with the Pi Centre and (potentially) other University entrepreneurship programmes."
"This course builds on the introduction to the law surrounding property ownership in Land Law and Equity and Trusts. It offers students the opportunity to explore a research question related to property law in greater depth. Student will formulate an adequate research question or questions raising significant issues related to property law and / or policy in Hong Kong and be introduced to a range of research methodologies for property law research. Students will develop their research and academic writing skills through the production of an independent research paper. They will also develop their ability to work in small, collaborative groups and develop digital literacies and presentation skills. Thus, the development of critical, creative and caring thought lies at the heart of all of the work that students will do on this course. Students will also develop collaborative skills and digital literacies that will prove useful in their later professional lives.Property ownership rights are of profound concern to individuals and have important social and economic consequences. For the purposes of this course, property law is broadly conceived but students might, for example, identify projects concerning:- The ownership of the family home;- The Small House Policy and the commercial exploitation of ding rights- The governance of Hong Kong’s multi-owned commercial and residential estates- The law of adverse possession - The law of undue influence and the protection of those who enter into transactions such as gifts, mortgages and guarantees under pressure from those capable of exploiting some form of vulnerability.Blended-mode class section is available for this course. Please refer to the “Class Notes” of the blended-mode class section for details."
"Students who enjoyed the PCLL pre-requisite Civil Procedure course (“the General Course”) may find this course fruitful. It bridges the degree level General Course and the PCLL LAWS 5004 Civil Litigation Practice course, as well as other PCLL civil litigation derivative courses (such as LAWS 5022 Conference Skills and LAWS 5020 Trial Advocacy). In particular, students who are interested in civil litigation and practising as barristers or litigation solicitors should find this course useful. This course builds on some of the General Course’s themes, exploring these in greater detail. It also introduces the concepts and contents of various new topics for which there was no time and space to develop in the General Course. This design of this course is in many respects similar to that of the General Course. Realism is the key theme. The course mimics many of the substantive issues that students will face in practice. It tests them on much of the content and many of the skills that students will be applying as soon as they begin practice."
"This course will introduce students to insolvency law, with a primary focus on the practical, legal and ethical issues confronted by insolvency practitioners working on company liquidation and personal insolvency cases. Practical matters such as dealing with conflicting creditor claims, recovering overseas assets, seeking foreign recognition of provisional liquidator for restructuring purpose and other matters will be explored during the course."
"This course will explore the evolution of modern legal orders, with a focus on the connections between contemporary law, empire, European colonization and the development of modern states.

Following that, the course will explore several important episodes relating to the development of modern legal systems, including the significance of pirates and contestations over the law of the sea to the formation of the contemporary international legal order; the manner in which the colonial office in Britain attempted to expand its authority across an increasing extensive British Empire, including through the appointment of powerful chief executives and the use of demonstrative trials and commissions of inquiry; the legal evolution of the United States from settler colony to global power, and some of the unique features of the system that arose as a result; and select topics pertaining to the formation of the contemporary legal orders in Mainland China and Hong Kong. Alongside the lectures and discussions, students will develop independent research projects, which they will have a chance to present and share in the latter part of the course."

"Mergers are the largest commercial transactions, and merger control is a fundamental part of competition law which regularly affects businesses in Hong Kong and around the world. Mergers between companies are frequent in the business world, and more than 100 countries have merger control laws that must be observed. Globalization inevitably implies that merger operations can bear effects on the conditions of competition in multiple jurisdictions, and therefore companies will have to ensure their operations comply with the laws of every jurisdiction that comes into play. Large transactions are often subject to scrutiny by several regimes simultaneously. As a consequence, companies need to be aware of the implications of the principal merger control regimes to avoid delays and uncertainty. Firms in Hong Kong whose operations might affect other markets regularly seek legal advice on merger control rules in jurisdictions such as the US, the EU and Mainland China.This course aims to provide students with a solid theoretical and practical understanding of the principal merger control regimes that affect companies in Hong Kong. On December 14, 2015, Hong Kong’s very own merger regime entered into force. For the time being, it only affects the telecommunications sector. The course will analyse local merger control rules as well as the rules of those regimes which most frequently apply to merger transactions involving local firms. Both procedural and substantive aspects are covered, and the principal focus of the course will be on substance."

How do novel computer interfaces affect consent and disclosure requirements? How can formalities be fulfilled electronically? What laws govern the Metaverse? What happens when commerce becomes paperless? The course is designed to give students more confidence when confronting legal problems of technological origin. It also enables students to tackle basic regulatory issues concerning online commercial activity and equips them with the tools necessary to build convincing arguments."
"This course provides an introduction to digital technology and law in three phases for each form of digital technology. First is an introduction to the particular type of digital technology, how it works and what is does, or at least is supposed to do. The use of this digital technology is then considered in the practice of law. The final phase of consideration of this form of digital technology is how the law affects it, or does not, and how it affects or may affect the law. For example, one of the first topics covered will be artificial intelligence (AI). Artificial intelligence will first be defined and explained, and possible developments of artificial intelligence considered including developments in machine learning and strong AI. Then we will consider how lawyers are using artificial intelligence for eDiscovery and eDueDiligence, how they may use if to assist in legal research, how it may replace lawyers, and the future for robo-lawyers and robo-judges. Then we will consider how law affects artificial intelligence. For example, how has financial regulation developed to deal with machines making life changing decisions for humans, how has the law of torts responded to autonomous vehicles, how has criminal law and international humanitarian law responded to autonomous weapons. Finally, we will consider how the law may develop to regulate the development and use of artificial intelligence. This three-phase approach will be followed for each form of digital technology covered on the course."

"Hong Kong is a small, but highly international, jurisdiction. Many legal disputes between private parties in Hong Kong involve legal rules, principles, and issues from other jurisdictions in China and abroad. These foreign laws are frequently inconsistent with the laws in Hong Kong. For instance, a contract concluded between a Hong Kong company and a US company in Japan may contain clauses that are enforceable in Japanese law but not in Hong Kong law. This course involves a study of the rules and principles for resolving conflicts that arise between Hong Kong law and the law of other jurisdictions. By incorporating a more extended range of mandatory readings than undergraduate courses of similar length and a more research-focused assessment regime, this course is designed specifically for students at the postgraduate level who have not previously studied the conflict of laws as it applies in a common law jurisdiction. The rules of Conflict of Laws (sometimes known as Private International Law) are orientated to answering three questions: (i) Which law applies in the event of a conflict? (ii) Do Hong Kong courts have jurisdiction to determine the dispute and should they exercise jurisdiction? (iii) Should a Hong Kong court recognise and enforce a foreign court’s judgment? These questions are examined in a few selected areas of law such as contracts, torts, family law, criminal law, and property."

"The course covers the key components of the formation of the insurance contract, claims and the regulation of insurance business and insurance intermediaries. Although it does not cover marine insurance in its own right, reference will be made to the Marine Insurance Act 1906 and to the case law decided thereunder relevant to non-marine insurance contracts. The course is concerned with English law, but reference will be made to developments in other common law jurisdictions (e.g. the USA, Canada and Australia) in order to see how insurance law issues may receive different judicial/legislative responses elsewhere. References to Hong Kong will be included in the fuller description. Although many students will already have a background in contract law, this is not necessary for this course so it is suitable for someone from a non-common law background. Those who have such a background will be familiar with some aspects (e.g. the analysis of offer and acceptance in the formation of a contract), but not only does the course go beyond the type of analysis employed by courses on the general principles of contract law (e.g. the course looks at regulation), it will quickly become clear that an insurance contract has a number of features that mark it out from most other types of contract: for instance, it is one of the few contracts where parties have a duty of disclosure before the contract. In particular, the course covers the following topics: - Elements of insurance - definitions; regulation of insurance business. - Insurance intermediaries - regulation; insurance agents; insurance brokers. - Insurable interest - indemnity; life & property policies; joint & composite insurance. - Formation - common law principles; premiums; commencement of the risk; cover notes; renewals. - Utmost good faith - the mutual duty of disclosure; misrepresentation; remedies for breach of duty. - Terms - warranties; conditions. - Construction of the policy - rules of construction; specific terms. - Causation - doctrine of proximate cause; the assured's misconduct. - The claims process - notification clauses; fraudulent claims; claims co-operation, good faith obligations on the insured and the insurer. - Resolving disputes, including the role of the ombudsman. - Indemnity - the indemnity principle; valued and unvalued policies; mitigation of loss and 'due precautions' conditions. - Reinstatement - contractual reinstatement; reinstatement under statue."
"The proposed course considers the historical origins of the modern corporation, how corporate prosecutions developed, and the various types of corporate crime. It will examine the cost and extent of corporate crime, and theories of how and why it happens. The course will examine some common law and UK legislative responses to particular types of crime – such as corporate manslaughter - and the theories and practice of corporate punishment. The course will also examine the advent of the theory and practice of ‘corporate social responsibility’, how businesses are expected to conduct their operations internationally with responsibility and accountability to their stakeholders and to wider society. It will examine how this expectation is framed in terms of human rights obligations. Students with an interest in corporate behaviour, crime, law and ethics will find this course useful. Students will be expected to undertake some independent research into a topic within the syllabus."

"Individuals – willingly or otherwise – tend to generate significant amounts of information in the course of their daily lives. This information can be processed by both state and non-state actors to generate profiles that may help predict future behaviour. While such categorization may in some circumstances be benign or even desired by the subject, if the information processing is unwanted or unknown it may implicate individual autonomy in important ways. This course will consider the normative values that may be threatened by various kinds of information gathering and processing, and consider what legal protections – if any – may be appropriate. Students will be exposed to the regulatory regimes and legal frameworks that govern the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information in both Hong Kong and in other jurisdictions. We will consider laws and policies that apply to both the private and the public sectors, and the ways in which they differ."
"Broadly, the aims for this course are for students to examine the political, economic, social, legal, and ideological contexts that create concepts of ‘marriage’ and that regulate marriage, both the formation and dissolution. Students will explore concepts of marriage, learn about the laws governing marital and quasi-marital relationships, and discuss the impact that the law has on family members when those relationships break down. The possibility for reform of marriage and legal recognition of quasi-marital relationships will also be considered. Students will also consider the adequacy of the law’s response to the problems of violence between spouses and partners and consider procedures, both judicial and non-judicial, for the resolution of matrimonial disputes. Topics include marriage, maintenance, nullity, separation, divorce, property arrangements on marriage breakdown including both court mandated and marital property agreements, the use of trusts law and company law to protect family wealth and the process of financial dispute resolution."

Students will consider the role of the law in addressing children’s relationships and welfare when the family breaks down, both in terms of private law and public law proceedings. In terms of private law proceedings students will become familiar with the child dispute resolution procedure and the court orders available with regard to maintenance and custody of children. In public law terms, students will also consider the adequacy of the law’s response to the problems of child abuse and neglect. The international aspect of child law will be addressed through the topics of child abduction and international adoption. Students will explore the discourse of children’s rights, the possibility of giving children a voice in any legal proceedings and further possibilities for reform of the law relating to children, in particular the law relating to custody."
"In partnership with a selected number of Clinic Partners, The Clinic for Public Interest Advocacy (CPIA) will place students in positions of responsibility to either (i) provide supervised assistance to disadvantaged and vulnerable members of the community or (ii) spearhead advocacy campaigns that are aimed at enhancing the legal interests of such individuals in Hong Kong.

In addition to the clinical placement, there will also be a taught component of the course which is focused on developing knowledge and skills on (i) public interest law in Hong Kong, (ii) legal strategies to protect the rights of individuals, particularly via judicial review and (iii) legal advocacy in a formal setting."
"Law remains the most enduring and impactful legacy of the Roman empire. Indeed, Rome possessed by far the most advanced and sophisticated system of law in antiquity. Its role as a progenitor of modern legal systems can hardly be overstated. Roman law is a foundation of virtually all modern Civil Law systems. It has also been an important influence in the development of the Common Law. Every educated lawyer should possess at least a basic understanding of Roman law, and every educated citizen should possess at least a basic knowledge of Roman history.This is a survey course on the Roman legal system and Roman history. The general approach will be to examine the evolving Roman legal system in terms of its most important features and characteristics. This will occur in the context of studying Rome’s extraordinary historical development from a tiny settlement on the banks of an obscure Italian river, to the largest empire of the pre-modern world, with a territory more extensive than that of the modern European Union. The roots of the Romans’ evident talent for law will also be explored."
"This course is about the makeup and breakdown of the law of the sea treaty regime.In September 2013, the United States, a non-signatory of the UN Convention on Law of the Sea, signed the latest in a number of maritime boundary conventions, this time with Kiribati. And in March 2014, China, a signatory of the Convention, deflected a Filipino submission to the Permanent Court of Arbitration over claims to parts of the South China Sea. These not atypical developments suggest that the modern law of the sea regime — put into place by three conferences held in 1958, 1960, and 1973-1982 — may not be as necessary, or as effective, as its proponents had once believed. Codifying the law of the sea was a hugely ambitious project, pushing at sovereignty’s last frontier before outer space. First, it aimed to absorb customary law on the territorial sea, the continental shelf, the high seas, and fishing, into a treaty regime. Second, it articulated new international law concepts such as ‘exclusive economic zone’, ‘archipelagic state’, and transit passage through international straits. And finally, it offered a range of options for dispute resolution, which, provided states did not opt out of the regime, demanded that once a decision was handed down, states were bound to abide by them. Two issues have dominated the development of the regime: international security and the exploitation of resources. The powerful maritime states have sought the right of innocent passage through territorial waters and EEZs, and pushed for rights when traversing the high seas, archipelagos and straits. At the same time, the coastal states have laid claim to expanded territorial waters, contiguous zones, exclusive economic zones, and greater control over the resources within them. The concerns over security and resources have touched every component of the Convention, from the protection of the marine environment, to the conduct of scientific research. Some tensions have not been resolved, and the coming period may see the fraying, if not the unravelling, of the current arrangements."

"Many questions can arise as we grow older and approach the latter years of life. Who will help me make good decisions when I lose legal capacity? How will I distribute my assets? What are my rights if I have suffered abuse in a care home? Will my advance medical directive be effective? In recent decades, elder law has emerged in numerous jurisdictions with ageing populations as a body of legal practice specializing in answering these questions that are of particular relevance for older clients. This course introduces students to a range of elder law issues in Hong Kong, with relevant insights from other jurisdictions with rapidly ageing populations such as Singapore, Australia, United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and the European Union."
"This course is about life and death – about the ability of mankind to restrain its environmental impact in order to make the existence of future generations possible. The International Geological Congress agreed in August 2016 that we had entered the Anthropocene – a new geological age where human influence has a distinct impact on most planetary systems. Greenhouse gas emissions from human activities have already caused an increase in global average temperature by 0.8 degrees Celsius and a raise of sea-level by 20 centimeters, triggering slow but dramatic planetary-wide adjustments. Efforts have been made to try to mitigate the disaster. Several treaties have been adopted since 1992. Under the US-China Joint Announcement of 2014 and the Paris Agreement of 2015, the world’s greatest economic actors agreed to accelerate and increase domestic measures. Substantial investments are being made to induce a global transition to “green” economy, with China progressively taking the lead. Hong Kong is bound by several treaties ratified by China. Hong Kong’s Climate Change Strategy and Action Agenda was adopted in 2010 and is being implemented through laws and policies in multiple sectors. Responses to climate change are increasingly impacting all aspects of the law, domestically and internationally. But is this sufficient? Will we, as a civilization and as a species, survive our entry in the Anthropocene?"

"This course provides an introduction to digital technology and law in three phases for each form of digital technology. First is an introduction to the particular type of digital technology, how it works and what is does, or at least is supposed to do. The use of this digital technology is then considered in the practice of law. The final phase of consideration of this form of digital technology is how the law affects it, or does not, and how it affects or may affect the law. For example, one of the first topics covered will be artificial intelligence (AI). Artificial intelligence will first be defined and explained, and possible developments of artificial intelligence considered including developments in machine learning and strong AI. Then we will consider how lawyers are using artificial intelligence for eDiscovery and eDueDiligence, how they may use if to assist in legal research, how it may replace lawyers, and the future for robo-lawyers and robo-judges. Then we will consider how law affects artificial intelligence. For example, how has financial regulation developed to deal with machines making life changing decisions for humans, how has the law of torts responded to autonomous vehicles, how has criminal law and international humanitarian law responded to autonomous weapons. Finally, we will consider how the law may develop to regulate the development and use of artificial intelligence. This three-phase approach will be followed for each form of digital technology covered on the course."
"China has been a CISG Contracting State since the entering into force of the CISG on 1 January 1988. The CISG has (officially) become effective also in Hong Kong as of 1 December 2022.

"This course is aimed at facilitating a critical understanding of cutting-edge technology, law and society in China. Rather than a general introduction to the Chinese legal system, this course cultivates, at an advanced level, an in-depth knowledge of and research skills concerning multiple dimensions of the intersections between law and technology in contemporary China. The proposed course is organised based on a series of interrelated but distinctive themes which captures the peculiar quality and unique characteristics of Chinese law and society. This course encourages the students to evaluate and critically reflect on fundamental theoretical and practical issues with regard to the emerging technology and associated legal and ethical issues in China.In an age of big data and artificial intelligence, what is the essential quality of the Chinese legal system that distinguishes it from the ‘Western’ model of the rule of law? What do these qualities tell us about the place of law and legal institutions in Chinese society?"
"Hong Kong is among the many regions of the world which share in the common law’s tradition, methods, rules, principles, and values. In this course, students will receive a solid grounding in the foundations and principal features of the common law as a legal system. Throughout the course, students will be expected to evaluate and discuss: (i) the extent to which the common law reflects and shapes the customs, traditions, and values of the society; (ii) the adaptability of the common law to serve different types of societies; and (iii) the role of the common law in underpinning civil and economic stability, liberty, and dynamism. Students will also develop their abstract-conceptual, research, and writing skills to a level appropriate for studies at the postgraduate level. Topics covered include: historical origins of the common law in England; the emergence of contract, tort, equity, and criminal law; the reception of the common law around the world; core values; major rules and principles and their relationship to the underlying society; stability and change in the common law – stare decisis, judicial reasoning, appeals; judicial independence; parliamentary supremacy; statutory interpretation and comparison with the Civil Law."
"This course examines the links between law, history, and culture. Law has long been seen, not as a stand alone tradition, but rather as a product of history and culture. Law is not comprehensible without knowledge of the formative processes of legal traditions and their incorporation as an attribute of culture formed over time. This course combines aspects of legal history and jurisprudence, especially sociology and political science. Students will gain a critical understanding of traditional and modern scholarship in these aspects of these fields and their relevance to law in contemporary society. Topics covered include: the Confucianist and anti-legalist traditions in China; the Greek/Roman law beginnings of the Western civil and common law traditions; the subsequent development of systems of law and government in both China and the West; and an introduction to jurisprudential, sociological, and political science theories in relation to these. The course situates itself squarely within the history and culture of Hong Kong society so that students gain a broader understanding of history, culture, and law in Hong Kong’s Chinese context."
"The purpose of this course is to educate students to think critically about the operation of the criminal justice system. Major aspects of the criminal process will be studied, and the focus throughout will be to contrast the theory of criminal law/criminal process with law in practice. The divergence between theory and practice will provide the springboard to encourage students to explore the nature of legal rules, the culture of criminal justice organisations, and how the socio-political context in which criminal law operates influences the treatment of various groups within the criminal process. Areas of study will include criminal statistics, police powers of arrest, search, detention and interrogation, the structure, organisation and work practices of prosecutors and defence lawyers, plea bargaining, the operation of prisons, and the effectiveness of non-custodial punishments. Course materials will draw heavily upon empirical research from around the world, and students will be encouraged to undertake assessments with an empirical component."
"This course is designed to give credit to the growing practical significance of comparative legal work. Through interactive teaching methods students will acquire specialised knowledge in the area of comparative law. Special emphasis is placed on the critical analysis of traditional concepts and the development of new perspectives in this area. Topics covered include: the concepts of comparative law and its significance in practice; the methods of comparative law; the history of comparative law; the (traditional) euro-centric approach of comparative law; the (traditional) private law-centred approach of comparative law; the legal family concept; mixed and harmonised legal systems; private law concepts; constitutional and administrative law concepts; and criminal law legal concepts. The course emphasizes the necessity to develop skills in the area of comparative law. Students will receive training in the areas of problem-solving, advocacy, drafting, and negotiation. Students will learn to appreciate the practical differences of various legal systems and develop tools to overcome related practical problems through in-class and take-home exercises."
"This course will survey copyright issues pertaining to digital subject matter, including multi media works, computer software, intranet and internet communications, from a global comparative perspective. Whether there is copyright subsistence and in what, whether infringement occurs and where, by whom (facilitator or browser, ‘down loader’ or ‘up loader’) what jurisdiction’s (or jurisdictions’) law governs, and the scope of implied licences are all considered. The US Digital Millennium Copyright Act 1998 and similar legislation in various jurisdictions, are considered as are the file sharing (P2P) cases, safe harbour legislation and procedures and other defences. Striking a balance between legitimate access to digital and other information technology in the interests of users and information provider competitors whilst preserving a sufficient incentive for copyright owners to make available digital information is the challenge for copyright law everywhere yet it is difficult to articulate the specifics of the law and technology let alone meet the challenge."
"Students will explore how Common Law has been carried into many parts of the world, and learn how in the modern state, legislated and administrative rules have greatly displaced judicially crafted solutions for the majority of legal problems. After presenting the essential characteristics of Common Law, the course will examine the three major waves of legal globalization: colonization in the 19th Century, the law and development movement of the post World War II period, and the ""Washington Consensus"" of the post Cold War period. Students will learn how colonial rules interacted with native Chinese law in Hong Kong, the difficulties of transplanting rules from one culture into another, and some aspects of the second-generation review of transplanted rules currently taking place. A main focus of the course will be to examine how rules (colonial, statutory and regulatory) have interacted with judicial action. We will in particular see how in the 20th Century, statutes and rules steadily came to dominate the field, leading to a convergence both of many individual bodies of rules and of the larger systems of Common and Civil Law. In sum, two sources of change will be studied: influence between legal systems and change within legal systems in response to changing circumstances. We will conclude with an investigation of the convergence of Common Law and Civil Law based not on geography and heritage, but on the type of problems addressed by a given law, the density of information and expert commentary available, and the existence of competent rule-making bodies. The course should give students a solid grasp of how legal systems can influence each other at the international level. It will introduce students to a debate on the quality of legal systems that has clouded the work of the World Bank and other development law projects in recent years. The course should particularly assist students in understanding and evaluating the policy thinking behind the transplanting of foreign models or laws into China, Hong Kong or another jurisdiction. It should also give students some insight into the legal history of Hong Kong."
"This course will: - provide a methodological framework for comparing constitutional architectures and to provide an understanding of the basic concepts of constitutional law; - introduce with the various types of political regimes by studying their principal institutions and their functioning (Great- Britain and German-Italy and Japan-Mainland China and Hong Kong-USA and France); - analyze the various forms of relationship between the executive authority, the legislative power and the judiciary and how they affect the nature of the political regime and protection of human rights; - finally, in support of practical examples (e.g. individual liberty and abortion - religious freedom and conscience in education...), analyze the importance of the constitutional norm in the protection of human rights, the various; methods of protecting this norm and their impact on the political power."
"First officially recognized in 1990, this is a new cause of action to stand alongside contract and tort in the law of obligations. This is a new and interesting area of contemporary legal development. The following topics will be covered during this course: the place of unjust enrichment in the law of obligations; remedies; subrogation; what counts as an enrichment; how the enrichment must be at the expense of the plaintiff; unjust factors such as mistake, duress, undue influence, exploitation of weakness, failure of consideration, legal compulsion, public authority ultra vires activity, ignorance, and necessity; defences; and controversies such as the nature of tracing, the availability of proprietary remedies, and the question of leapfrogging."
"In recent years the term “cultural heritage” has been used in many domestic laws, international agreements, conventions and treaties, and academic works to refer indiscriminately to art and antiquities. This course considers the meaning of the terms “art”, “antiquities” and “cultural heritage” and the legal frameworks which affect them in Hong Kong and internationally. The course begins by considering the use of these terms and the distinct and overlapping laws which affect them. The course continues considering the issues affecting the ownership, transfer and protection of art, antiquities and cultural heritage in Hong Kong and the development of international measures intended to protect art, antiquities and cultural heritage. The rise of the art and antiquities market in China and the special position of Hong Kong as a market for Chinese artifacts in the legitimate global trade in art and antiques and its position in the illicit trade will also be considered. The issues of illicit trafficking of art, antiquities and cultural heritage will be considered and the use of art, antiquities and cultural heritage for money laundering and the financing of terror. The course will consider issues of repatriation of cultural property from private and public collections, for example the looting of the Summer Palace in Beijing. Recent issues involving the protection of heritage in armed conflict and the political value in protecting and/or destroying art, antiquities and cultural heritage will also be considered."
"This course provides an opportunity for students to study select global issues in law. Topics vary according to the area of expertise of the course leader and the interests of the class. The aim of the course is to encourage students to think like global lawyers. Upon completion of the course, students should be able to deal with different legal systems and legal traditions."
"This course of Cyberlaw (or Internet law) covers the legal issues related to use of the Internet. It will begin by considering the origins and development of information technology in the booming Internet economy, moving on to consider, through the key issue of cyber property, both how the law has responded to the challenges of information technologies, and the extent to which legal issues have shaped the development of information society policy. Finally, this course provides a strong practical training by devoting lectures to the dispute settlement of internet domain disputes with focus on the Hong Kong practice."
"In this course, the connections between law, empire, and decolonisation / self-determination will be examined. The course has three basic parts. In Part I, we will establish an understanding of the basic concepts involved in the relationship between law and colonial systems. The historical background of colonial legal systems and their current and former international legal status will also be examined. In Part II, the course will look in more detail at the specific legal standards that developed under the conditions of colonialism, e.g. those related to slavery, restricted definitions of citizenship, capacity for territorial acquisition and native title, and others. Related academic theories and detailed historical studies will also be introduced. Part III, finally, will address the various forms that “decolonisation” has taken at the domestic and international levels, and ask students to develop their own arguments regarding the best approach for legal systems transitioning towards self-determination."
"The ‘rule of law’ is typically thought of as an unmitigated good. Examining the history of the rule of law in the colonial context complicates this picture, however, revealing that the advancement of the ‘rule of law’ has often equally involved a project of expanding control, which has not always been linked to enhancements in peoples’ rights, or even respect for basic principles of legality.This class aims to explore the tensions inherent in the confcept by examining the history and evolution of public order governance in the British Empire. The class begins by exploring the ideologies that underpinned approaches to public order governance, considering (elite) attitudes towards the masses of the people and the challenges of governance both at home and in the colonies. The next portion of the class explores ‘everyday’ forms of public order governance, including informal and state violence, the evolution of the police, and the ways in which law evolved in order to ensure wealth generation. Following these examinations, the course turns to consider more exceptional modes of public order governance, including the policing of protests, the imposition of emergency and martial law, the development of intelligence services and counterinsurgency policy. The course concludes with some reflections on the rule of law in the colonial context more broadly, as well as with an examination of some of the ongoing resonances of colonial legality in the contemporary period."
"Students will gain insights into AI technology, understand how AI will impact both the future of the legal profession and humanity more generally. Students will also have the opportunity to focus their interest on a particular practice area of law that is affected by AI technology."
"This course introduces basic ideas and concepts of the law governing international business transactions. It explains the advantages and disadvantages of non-investment and investment related business transactions and analyses critically how cross-border business activities have developed over the past 100 years and what this means for different concerned parties and societies. It goes on to introduce reasons for attempts to regulate cross-border business activities on the international and on the domestic level and analyses in detail the related legal regimes. On the basis of a critical discussion of different types of cross-border business activities, students will obtain a thorough understanding of the legal sources governing cross-border business activities on the domestic and on the international levels. The main part of the course is dedicated to international trade related legal issues thus exemplifying the significance of trans-national business activities. Topics to be addressed in detail are: (1) forms of doing cross-border trade; (2) conflict of (trade) laws; (3) sources of the law of international sales of goods; (4) contract practice, contract terms, INCOTERMS, and customary trade usages; (5) transport of exports; (6) financing international trade; (7) terms of payment; (8) breach of international contracts; (9) force majeure; (10) transfer of property and retention of title; (11) commercial invoices, packing, insurance issues; (12) cross-border product liability; (13) taxation of international trade activities; (14) customs law, anti dumping law and other governmental restrictions. While the course discusses topics from the viewpoint of all concerned parties, it focuses on aspects which are relevant for private business entities which engage in international trade. Therefore, skills-based training modules, such as negotiation, drafting, presentation, and problem-solving exercises are used in order to allow students to explore the relevance of related issues ‘on the job’."
"This course analyses critically legal aspects of cross-border investment activities. It explains the legal framework governing international merger and acquisition activities on the domestic and the public international law level, but it focuses on transactional aspects from the viewpoint of private investors. Major topics will be studied through in-class exercises, thus allowing students to gain the practical core skills that are necessary to deal with related issues in private practice. These skills-based training modules will include amongst others drafting, negotiation, presentation, and dispute settlement exercises. Topics covered include: investment versus non-investment related cross-border business activities; the historical development and present significance of international merger and acquisition activities; different forms of investment vehicles from a comparative perspective; domestic and public international law sources of investment law; investment restrictions; cross-border investment and corruption; structuring investment projects; due diligence; contract issues (including pre-signing arrangements, reps and warranties, disclosure letters); cross-border investment and technology transfer; labour issues; and the taxation of cross-border investment projects."
"This course covers theoretical and practical legal questions arising out of trans-national scenarios. It introduces and analyses the special issues to be dealt with in this context and the solutions that have been developed on the public international law level and on the level of domestic law. The course has three main parts. Part I will enable students to identify and examine the reasons for the special problems that must be addressed in transnational contexts. Emphasis is placed on the critical analysis of political, socio-economic, and cultural aspects of trans-national legal problems and the significance and impact of respective legal structures in light of the globalisation of the world’s legal regimes. Part II covers public international law related aspects of trans-national scenarios. It provides an advanced understanding of the historical development, the sources, and the main subjects (players) of public international law. Part III addresses trans-national problems arising in relation to and among individuals and/or private entities with a focus on private international law concepts. It also examines attempts to harmonise legal rules applied in different jurisdictions. The course provides students with substantive legal knowledge as well as enables them to develop advanced legal skills. Students will be requested to contribute actively to their own learning experience in forms such as in-class exercises and presentations as well as library-based research."
"This course will focus on how countries can develop economically (and what constraints they face) within the framework of international economic law (IEL). In order to provide students with a full understanding of economic development through the use of international economic law, this course will also blend theory and practice. The course will address the general issues of the role of states and international organisations in economic development, as well as the (changing) role of IEL in economic development. The course will be devoted to case studies of select countries, focusing on their use of IEL in economic development and will analyse recent movements toward regional integration."
"The focus of this course is on the legal structure that affects globalization. For our purposes we can think of globalization as the process by which national economies become interdependent and interlinked. This course introduces students to the legal, business and policy aspects of international trade, focusing on the complex legal framework of the various WTO Agreements as well as recent bilateral and regional trade agreements. This course analyses the legal framework of the WTO by studying the regulatory legal principles of the WTO and how they operate at both the national and international level. More specifically, the course covers issues such as tariffs and tariff negotiations, quotas, most favoured nation clauses, regional trading blocs, national treatment clauses and exceptions for environmental, health and safety and other policies, anti-dumping, export subsidies, countervailing duties, international rules on patents and copyrights and other topics of contemporary importance currently being debated. The course should give participants a sound understanding of key legal issues and principles relating to international trade and a thorough knowledge and understanding of the importance of domestic and international policy issues to the world trading system. There are no prerequisites for this course and no background in economics, international relations or international law is assumed."
"This course seeks to identify society’s perception of its economic, social, and other needs with respect to banking and financial regulation, and examines the underlying principles that law has offered to meet these needs. Proceeding from an international and comparative perspective, the course examines the system of financial and banking regulations in selected jurisdictions including Hong Kong and other Asian countries. The rule setting process periodically initiated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) as international bodies monitoring the global financial system will be introduced. The roles of Hong Kong as BCBS member and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority as FSB member will be analysed, particularly with respect to the implementation of rules and standards. While the focus of the course is on banking regulatory law, reference will be made to legal concepts facilitating international financial transactions with relevance for doing business in Hong Kong, such as for example the standards set by the London-based Loan Market Association (LMA) or Islamic finance. Students will also develop problem-solving and legal research, writing, and presentation skills to an appropriate postgraduate level."
"This course focuses on aspects of international taxation from the viewpoint of an economist. It introduces the concept of taxation including basic accounting principles and analyses critically their significance for the different concerned parties. It explains different tax types by giving country specific examples. Students will gain a thorough understanding of the reasons for the attempts to establish an international tax system, why these attempts have failed, and what this means for international business activities. Common taxation principles applied in many countries in relation to direct and indirect taxes will be discussed as well as tax regimes that have been enacted on the level of international organisations. The problem of double taxation as well as the specifics of bilateral and multilateral tax treaties will be analysed in detail. In its last part, the course focuses on the question of how private business entities react or should react to specific tax regimes. Transfer pricing, tax evasion, and tax avoidance are examined critically as well as counter-measures taken on the domestic and the international level. The course focuses on practical tax issues as they are to be understood and applied by international business lawyers. It therefore incorporates many exercises, thus enabling students to identify tax-related issues that may become important in the context of international business transactions and to develop appropriate practical solutions. The course may be combined with an equivalent course offered in other departments at CUHK."
"This course examines the legal and regulatory aspects of electronic commerce. It presents the theoretical as well as the technical background of electronic commerce to illustrate the complexity of the Internet value chain and to enable students to comprehend its implications (and limitations!) for business. The legal landscape of e-commerce is presented against the backdrop of current technological trends and developing commercial practices. By giving a snapshot of the e-commerce market, its major players and dominant business models, the individual topics examine the interplay between law and technology. What are the legal implications of transaction automation? How do the novel computer interfaces affect traditional consent and disclosure requirements? Can formal requirements be digitized? The course is practice-oriented and designed to give students more confidence when confronting legal problems of technological origin. It also enables students to tackle basic regulatory issues concerning online commercial activity and equips them with the tools necessary to build convincing arguments. The course also examines the intersections of electronic commerce with aspects of data protection, privacy as well as intellectual property law to present a holistic picture of the global digital economy."
"This course examines the principles underlying international competition law. Free market economic theory and practice pervades contemporary international commerce in an unprecedented and increasingly globalised manner. A cornerstone of free market economic theory is the necessity to remove distortions to competition such as monopolies, oligopolies, and anti-competitive behaviour. Proceeding from an international and comparative perspective, the course examines the competition law of selected jurisdictions, principally Hong Kong, Mainland China, the United States and the European Union. Students will gain a critical understanding of these historically and culturally formed areas of law and their place in an increasingly globalised society. Students will also develop their problem-solving, legal research, writing, and presentation skills to an appropriate postgraduate level."
"This course explains legal principles governing the transport of goods to international or national consignees. It explains the various forms of shipping by sea, land, and air (mono-modal and multi-modal) and related domestic and public international legal regimes. It discusses in detail topics that are crucial for legal practitioners such as different types of contracts of carriage and their major contents, freight-related issues, bills of lading and other carriage documents, the liability of carriers, specifics of container transport arrangements, special issues regarding transport-related dispute settlement as well as topical issues regarding the insurance of goods in transit. Students will have acquired an advanced understanding of the practical impact of shipping law related issues. The course will be taught in an interactive manner with many in-class and take-home exercises, thus allowing students to develop their problem-solving, research, writing, and presentation skills to an appropriate postgraduate level."
"This course provides students with an advanced knowledge of the advantages, principles, process, and rules of conduct of international commercial arbitration. The course covers the substantive aspects of an international arbitration agreement, the regulatory framework of international arbitration (including national statutes, procedural rules and soft law instruments), issues of arbitral jurisdiction, the arbitral process itself, and the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards. Particular attention is paid to issues involving the drafting and recognition of arbitration agreements and the role of the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. Students will be introduced to this area of international dispute settlement through a combination of theoretical and practical perspectives."
"This course explores how society regulates ownership, control, and access to ideas, and examines the underlying principles of the relevant law. These principles include registered and unregistered trademarks (passing off), domain names, copyright, patents, designs, trade secrets, plant varieties, and silicon chip topography. These are studied against the background of modern information society - especially digital subject matter (internet and multimedia), bio-technology, and other applied sciences. Proceeding from an international and comparative perspective, the course examines the development of the international intellectual property law system culminating in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) TRIPs agreement. TRIPs has led to an unprecedented level of uniformity of national legal regimes dealing with intellectual property, perhaps the most uniform of all legal regimes. Differences in specific jurisdictions remain. With a view to exploring these differences, attention will be directed to selected jurisdictions including the Commonwealth, the United States, and China. Students will gain a critical understanding of the law in an increasingly globalised society. Students will also develop their problem-solving, legal research, writing, and presentation skills to an appropriate postgraduate level."
This course studies the international legal response to environmental concerns. Students will gain an understanding of the trans-border and global nature of environmental problems and the need for internationally co-ordinated efforts to tackle the problems effectively.
"This course is designed to teach students substantive contract law in major legal traditions from a comparative perspective. It will explore the political, socio-economic, and historical environment in which modern contract law has evolved in countries of different legal tradition. The basic principles and doctrines of contract law will be explored from a comparative perspective by examining divergent legal concepts, techniques, and institutions."
"In a narrow sense ‘corporate governance’ can be defined as providing the rules and incentives to establish structure and control over the set of relationships in company law between management, the board, the shareholders, and stakeholders. In the broader sense, it can also be defined as the rules that create the necessary conditions for market confidence, the creation of wealth, and investor protection at the national and international level. In addition, there are different systems of corporate governance functioning today with different solutions to the problems of maximisation of shareholder wealth, accountability, and investor protection. Models of good corporate governance can therefore be examined from the perspective of Continental European regimes such as the German or French models and the Anglo-American type of governance, such as found in the United Kingdom, Delaware in the United States, and Hong Kong. This course analyses the different models of corporate governance and the key characteristics of these different systems with a focus on their significance for Hong Kong and the Greater China region."
"Company law systems in the world today are said to be converging into a single American model exemplified by the so-called ‘Washington Consensus’ in international finance and trade relationships. This course explores the different models of company law operating at national, regional, and global levels and compares their differences in form and substance. Students will analyse the strengths and weaknesses of the different models and identify those characteristics that find equivalence in today’s global regulatory, financial, and accounting systems. Students are expected to build upon their own knowledge of company law and regulatory regimes in their own jurisdiction to bring a comparative law approach to this course."
"This course examines the rules and regulations governing the different forms of doing business in Hong Kong in their social, economic, and political contexts. Students will acquire an advanced understanding of the law governing commercial activities in Hong Kong and how the players in the market respond to related rules in practice. In order to point out the practical significance of specific aspects, integrated skills training modules will serve as the main teaching devices. Topics covered include: commercial contracts (sales and distribution, agency, leasing, franchising, banking and finance, licensing, insurance); business organisations (sole proprietorships, partnerships, companies and other business vehicles); insolvency and bankruptcy; consumer protection; and professional liability."
"With 27 member states, the European Union (‘EU’) is one of Hong Kong’s and Mainland China’s largest trading partners. In terms of GDP, it also possesses the second largest internal market in the world. Since its establishment in 1957 as the ‘European Economic Community’ or the ‘Common Market’, it has developed a sophisticated body of law and an elaborate set of institutions concerning mainly economic and trade matters. This course acquaints students with the EU’s institutional (executive, legislative, and judicial) system and the law establishing and regulating its internal market, with particular reference to the four economic freedoms of movement (goods, persons, services, and capital)."
"This course examines the actors, dynamics, strategies, and rules of the changing international political system and the patterns of interaction among the powers. It examines the essential concepts and theories in international relations in order to enhance students’ understanding of international affairs, especially those in relation to law, and to develop relevant analytical skills. Students are encouraged to think critically about international issues by applying international relations theories and social science research skills that are taught in the course."
"This course seeks to introduce different aspects of the international financial and accounting systems from an economist’s point of view. It is divided into two parts. Part one focuses on the historical development and the current status of the International Monetary System. Students will acquire an understanding of the emergence of international monetary systems and their development into the Bretton Woods Conference. Goals, organisational structure, and the functioning of the IMF and the World Bank will be studied in detail. Students will also learn about the financing of international business transactions with an emphasis on practical aspects from the viewpoint of private business entities. The second part of the course explains basic accounting concepts and principles with a focus on their significance for cross-border business transactions. It analyses the significance of the enactment of proper accounting systems and their implementation on the national and supra-national level. Students will acquire skills that are necessary to assess the financial viability of different forms of international business transactions. Students will also improve their problem-solving, research, writing, and presentation skills through in-class and take-home exercises."
"This course introduces the main concepts and ideas of international business activities from the viewpoint of an economist. It discusses the functioning of the world’s economy/ economies in light of internationalisation and globalisation of the markets. Students will learn how internationalisation and globalisation impact on national economies and societies as well as on specific industries, business entities, and individuals and how the different players in the international markets respond or may respond to related challenges. Upon completion of the course students will be in a position to identify issues of concern as well as to collect and evaluate date related to macro- and micro economic issues. Specific topics covered by the course are: (1) definition, development, and critical analysis of major concepts of international economics; (2) economic research methods; (3) internationalisation and globalisation of the world’s economies; (4) international and regional economic and monetary organisations (with a focus on the Greater China area); (5) international trade; (6) international investment/MNEs; (7) international banking, finance, and payment methods; (8) international/cross-cultural management; (9) international marketing and price management; (10) international division of labour and personnel management; and (11) international controlling and accounting."
"This course focuses on core legal skills to be applied by lawyers involved in cross-border business transactions. The focus of the teaching will be on the creation of an active teaching and learning environment with a view on the practical significance of different skill to be explained and demonstrated by lecturers with substantive practical background. The course will consist of three different parts, namely legal writing skills, public speaking/presentation skill and reading financial statements."
"The recent development of international investment protection law is remarkable and international investment law is emerging as a distinct and important field of international law. There has been a dramatic increase in the number of bilateral investment treaties (European Union-China, U.S.-China…) and other agreements with investment related provisions (Transpacific Partnership, Trilateral Treaty…). Foreign investments play a pivotal role in most countries’ political economies. The benefits of inward investments include, amongst others, the following: developing a sound economic structure; increasing and diversifying manufacturing; offering novel and more developed services; creating employment; and bringing innovative technology. Conversely, outward investment can bring long-term capital gains to the home country, help to build economic and political ties with other nations, and, in some cases, to ensure access to critical natural resources. In order to encourage cross-border capital flows, countries have taken various steps such as revising their domestic legal frameworks to liberalise rules on inward and outward investment and to create special regimes which provide incentives and protections for foreign investment. Alongside the developments in domestic laws, countries have also taken bilateral and multilateral action including entering into trade and/or investment agreements. In spite of political and ideological disparities, by the end of the twentieth century an international regime of foreign investment had emerged. Since the conclusion of the first bilateral investment treaty (BIT) in 1959, international investment agreements (IIAs) have significantly increased both in number and importance. As of Ausgust 1, 2016, there are over 3,200 IIAs (including treaties concluded by the HK Government which are different from the PRC treaties). The primary purpose of these proliferating norms is to ‘provide stability and security for foreign investors by limiting the range of legitimate government interventions in their affairs and by providing compensation should these norms be violated’. In exchange for these commitments, states would receive investment inflows and the benefits of the alleged consequent economic development. Recent years have witnessed the rapidly evolving dynamics of foreign investment and trade in Asia as investment into and within the region grows rapidly. Countries such as the People’s Republic of China (China), India, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, and South Korea are now increasingly investing abroad; at the same time, many developing countries in the region are looking to leverage foreign investment for economic growth. These trends raise new policy questions for the home and host countries which are seeking to maximise the benefits of such outward and inward investment, while also mitigating the potential social and environmental costs.This course aims to introduce the students to the public international law standards for the treatment of foreign investments. Students will gain a thorough understanding of the theory and practice of international investment law, through lectures, case study, in-class discussions and group presentations. This course will examine the substantive law governing international investment and the growing role of investment law in the international legal system."
"The learning aim of the course is to enable the student to develop a deep and achieving learning approach that is rich in critical thought and in applied knowledge to the study of Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs) in the context of the World Trade Organization (WTO). In this course, students will have an opportunity to examine: 1. Customs Unions and Free Trade Areas a) Terminology of PTAs b) Typology of PTAs 2. Criteria of PTAs a) Economic Criteria b) Political Criteria c) Political Economy Criteria d) National Security Criteria e) Cultural Criteria f) Imperialist Criteria 3. General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT) and General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) a) Article XXIV GATT b) Article V GATS 4. Preferential Rules of Origin in PTAs a) Theory b) Practice 5. Typical PTA Provisions a) Market Access b) Government Procurement c) Intellectual Property d) Foreign Direct Investment e) Competition Policy f) Labour g) Environment h) Transparency i) Dispute Resolution"
"Ensuring secure and reliable energy supply in a climate-friendly and socially responsible way is one of the most important challenges that most states over the world are facing today. The law – both at the international and national levels – has a crucial role to play in achieving these energy policy objectives. Creating an appropriate regulatory environment for energy trade and investment is a highly complex exercise – but the success of this task is essential in determining the ability of states to fuel economic development, ensure social welfare and protect the environment. On the one hand, governments require a certain level of regulatory flexibility to react to rapid developments on the global energy markets. On the other hand, investors in the capital-intensive and long-term energy sector require stability and predictability of the “rules of the game” governing their economic activities.This course examines the regulation of the energy sector from an international and comparative law perspective. It presents the key concepts of energy law in the light of the policy challenges characterizing the energy landscape of the 21st Century. The focus is on the law of energy security, energy investments and energy trade – with a specific interest for the liberalization of energy markets (i.e. opening of energy markets to competition) and the de-carbonization of energy supply (i.e. the re-orientation of the energy system towards climate-friendly patterns). The objective of this course is to equip students with the necessary tools to critically engage with the complex – but highly important – legal questions relating to the organization of energy supply."
"This course provides an opportunity for students to study select global issues in law. Topics vary according to the area of expertise of the course leader and the interests of the class. The aim of the course is to encourage students to think like global lawyers. Upon completion of the course, students should be able to deal with different legal systems and legal traditions."
"The course will examine a number of issues in contemporary studies that may arise from interdisciplinary research projects. A series of topics that are related to tax law in specific jurisdictions including Hong Kong, Mainland China, Europe and North America will be selected and examined from a wide range of policy perspectives. Some of traditional theories and principles in tax law will be confronted with the recent changes and development in the field of tax law as well as in other fields of law, politics, and economics. Each class will be consisted of paper presentation by the authors and questions and comments made by the students and the convenor. Students must read the papers that will be discussed during the class and prepare brief response commentaries before the class starts."
"Mergers are the largest commercial transactions, and merger control is a fundamental part of competition law which regularly affects businesses in Hong Kong. Mergers between companies are frequent in the business world, and more than 100 countries around the world have merger control laws that must be observed. Globalization inevitably implies that merger operations can bear effects on the conditions of competition in multiple jurisdictions, and therefore companies will have to ensure that their operations comply with the laws of every jurisdiction that comes into play. The large transactions are often subject to scrutiny by several regimes simultaneously. As a consequence, companies need to be aware of the implications of the principal merger control regimes to avoid delays and uncertainty. Firms in Hong Kong whose operations might affect other markets regularly seek legal advice on merger control rules in jurisdictions such as the US, the EU and Mainland China.This course aims to provide students with a solid theoretical and practical understanding of the principal merger control regimes that affect companies in Hong Kong. On December 14, 2015, Hong Kong’s very own merger regime entered into force. For the time being, it only affects the telecommunications sector. The course will analyse local merger control rules as well as the rules of those regimes which most frequently apply to merger transactions involving local firms. Both procedural and substantive aspects are covered, and the principal focus of the course will be on substance."
"This course builds on LAWS6315 ‘Principles of Competition Law’, and focuses on specific anti-competitive practices, both collaborative and unilateral, as well as particular issues arising from the application of competition law (in particular, the interaction between competition law and intellectual property rights, and the interaction between competition and sector-specific regulation). Since December 14, 2015, Hong Kong has a fully operational cross-sector competition law. This course will examine the most important challenges competition law enforcers in this jurisdiction currently have to address, and will look at the experience of other regimes in order to discuss how best to tackle these pressing issues. The course will adopt a principally practical approach, giving students the opportunity to conduct case studies and engage in class debates on specific topics."
"In practice, IIAs entail conflicts of interest between the investor and the host state over the nature of the control that could be exercised over the foreign investment. Essentially, the investor’s interest is to control its investment within a stable and predictable legal regime, while the host state seeks to exert its sovereign power to define its policies. Investor–state arbitration is deemed to be a crucial feature of foreign investment protection because it provides access to a neutral forum for the settlement of disputes. Investor–state arbitration is not only an alternative to the domestic courts of the host state, but also a technique that ‘depoliticises’ the disputes, by removing them from the intergovernmental political relationship between the home state and the host state. The course on “Investor-State Dispute Settlement” would be more than a course on arbitration. In fact, it is designed as a specialized course which pays attention to the great specifity of Investor-State Dispute Settlement."
"This is an arbitration course. It is a course about investor claims against sovereign host states – i.e. investor-state disputes (or “ISDS”) – often but not always involving public, treaty rights. Often, such arbitration involves contractual and other rights such as those granted under host State legislation. In contrast, international commercial arbitration deals with the resolution of disputes over purely private law rights between what are, typically although certainly not always, private parties.The course is intended to provide an overview of the practice of investment arbitration based upon the development of substantive law, procedural principles and the growth of practice in the field. It is aimed at graduate students who may wish to develop a serious interest in arbitration, as well as those who though not necessarily wishing to pursue the subject in greater detail would like to have an understanding of it so as to complement their knowledge of international law, transnational law, international disputes practice or energy transactions.The course will be taught from the viewpoint of a commercial practitioner who worked as a former government treaty advisor and UN international lawyer."
"International Economic Law is the busiest field of international dispute settlement. This course examines the different professionals that operate before international courts and tribunals in this domain. It examines the main rules of conduct applicable to participants in the international legal profession, encouraging students to critically reflect on select ethical controversies and dilemmas.The course seeks to enrich students’ understanding about different professional pathways, how they interact in real life, and the challenges they face in the international job market. Law and Economics and Legal Sociology studies have demonstrated that the practice of international dispute settlement is shaped by non-legal factors, such as financial incentives and social factors. These approaches offer a valuable lens into the development of the international legal community and the interactions among its members. Drawing on a range of theoretical perspectives, this course explores the role of international legal professionals in contemporary International Economic Law and discusses a number of select issues that have arisen in recent practice which pose significant challenges to the future of the field."
"This course includes the teaching of the three primary conflicts topics, namely jurisdiction, choice of law and the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments. However, unlike a traditional private international law course, this course focuses only on international commercial issues relating to contract, tort and company laws, without spending time on domicile, family and succession laws. In addition, it covers important interim relief such as Mareva injunction and taking of evidence abroad. While the course centers on conflict of laws of Hong Kong, due to the nature of complex international transactions, the conflicts rules of other major jurisdictions, particularly those of China, the United States and the European Union will be referred to throughout the course for comparison."
"This course examines the legal aspects of the digital economy in a globalized world, with emphasis on the developments in Hong Kong, Mainland China, the United States and the European Union. The principal focus is on the regulatory challenges raised by platform ecosystems. Digital platforms reach virtually every aspect of our lives, and their ‘gatekeeping’ allows businesses and their prospective customers to connect. Their business model has created new markets and reshaped Internet governance, with the potential to boost consumer choice and job creation. At the same time, the power amassed by gatekeepers allows them to shape the conduct of consumers, affect competitors, and control the content we access online, raising significant legal concerns. All of this needs to be analyzed against the backdrop of a fierce US-China tech war that is leaving an imprint on the legal framework.The course will cover key issues like platform governance, liability for online intermediaries, online data protection and content moderation, the role of competition law in controlling the power of digital gatekeepers, the regulation of platform workers, and conflicts of law arising over cross-border data governance or taxation matters. It is designed for anyone interested in the role of platforms in global digital trade and the evolving laws affecting the digital economy."
"Hong Kong has been one of the world’s leading centers of project finance activity for decades. Its leadership position is the product of its prominence as a world financial center, its proximity to rapidly growing economies, its legal system and its appeal to the mix of investors, developers, bankers, lawyers and other technical, insurance and environmental consultants who are needed to identify, secure, structure, document and finance complex infrastructure projects.Hong Kong’s domestic growth has been fueled in part by the development of its port terminals, rail network, toll roads, tunnels and bridges. However, many of the projects that originate in Hong Kong are completed outside of Hong Kong and involve cross-border flows of expertise and capital. Thus, in order to get a more authentic view of the practice in Hong Kong, we will study project finance from a cross-border perspective.Our focus will be the energy sector and the main case we will study throughout the course will involve the cross-border development and project financing of an electric power plant. Where appropriate, we will also consider how other types of projects within the energy sector differ from our case study to broaden our understanding of how project finance is used in practice."
"To address the challenge of climate change, it is necessary to urgently reorganize energy systems that are currently responsible for a significant share of greenhouse gas emissions as fossil fuels continue to dominate electricity production and heating. Renewable energy technologies are playing an increasingly important role in electricity production, and by 2050 are expected to generate most electricity produced as states implement the carbon neutrality (net-zero) targets announced as part of their contribution to international climate change mitigation efforts. The replacement of fossil energies with renewable energies requires a solid legal framework to incentivize the development of new technologies and deploy these new technologies in the energy systems. The course examines the legal arrangements that states have adopted to achieve this dual innovation and decarbonization objective. An comparative approach is taken, looking at the EU experience (a choice justified based on the EU leadership in the field of decarbonization), China (the leading manufacturer of clean technology) and the US. The clean technologies that are needed to decarbonize energy systems are of increasing importance for global trade and investment flows, with states intensifying their efforts to replace fossil energies. The course studies the crossborder trade and investment disputes that have taken place in the clean technology sector, in view of understanding how international economic law applies to this new industry."
"This course will introduce the legal principles governing the international approach to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Moreover, this course will introduce the main concepts relating to the regulation of investments in clean energy production and trade in clean energy products. The focus will be on the legal aspects of the transition towards a green economy. Besides the analysis of the international climate change regime, topics covered by this course include: the support of clean energy technologies, the access of clean energy producers to the network infrastructure, contracts governing the trade in clean energy."
"This course will focus on the means by which the state controls exploitation of its oil and gas reserves. The specific characteristics of the oil and gas business (exploration, exploitation, transportation and sale) call for specific regulatory and contractual approaches. Following an introduction into the ownership of oil and gas resources and rights, the course examines how states license activities in this sector and how oil and gas rights are transferred between the main stakeholders. Besides exploration and exploitation of oil and gas, states regulate the infrastructure necessary to transport these resources to the market. This course examines how companies can obtain access to existing oil and gas pipelines, and how companies can develop new pipeline infrastructure. Taking into account the commercial interests at stake and the very high technical and political risks in the sector, energy activities are governed by a complex system of contractual arrangements. This course examines the main agreements between energy companies and states, and the agreements that regulate the interaction between energy companies. Oil and gas activities can have a significant impact on the environment. This course examines principles of health and safety regulation, as well as the question of decommissioning of oil and gas installations (with a focus on offshore installations) and the regulation of unconventional oil and gas production. The development of shale gas has transformed energy markets, but has also been criticized for its environmental impact. This course examines the environmental regulations that apply to these relatively new forms of energy production."
"The rapid increase in the number of arbitral awards and trade-related decisions concerning the energy industry has highlighted the crucial importance of investment, trade and commercial law for the energy industry – and thus for energy lawyers. Vice versa, energy is a sector of key relevance for practicing lawyers in the field of commercial, trade and investment dispute resolution. Achieving energy security in a climate-friendly way requires massive investments in the development and decarbonization of the energy infrastructure. Besides investment flows, energy security and decarbonization have a significant impact on global trade. However, cross-border energy investment and trade flows face regulatory obstacles that can negatively impact on the ability of states to ensure the dual energy-related objectives of security of supply and climate change mitigation. On the one hand, energy investments are capital intensive and characterized with a long-term payback period. Investors therefore require strong guarantees that states and their contractual counterparts will respect the “rules of the game” that constitute the basis of their investments. On the other hand, because of the strategic and social importance of the energy industry (including green energy), states are tempted to interfere with foreign energy investments and introduce protectionist measures to promote the domestic manufacturing industry. This course examines how tribunals/panels balance investor protection and free trade with the regulation by state of security and environmental protection in the strategic energy industry.The course is divided in three parts: investment arbitration, commercial arbitration and the resolution of trade disputes."
"This course concentrates on the links between environmental law, climate change and the regulation of domestic and cross-border energy undertakings from the perspective of disaster risk reduction. Both the natural environment (e.g. earthquakes, typhoons and floods) and human activities (e.g. industrial accidents and oil spills) present material risks for energy industries and in recent times energy undertakings have suffered from and contributed to environmental catastrophes. There are a number of domestic and international legal models and regulatory schemes focused on disaster risk reduction, in particular for risks posed by human activities (e.g. the Seveso Directives in the EU). Less well-developed is the law on natural disaster risk reduction. What can comparative and international environmental law contribute here, at a time when: (i) climate change will almost certainly increase the risks posed by the natural environment; and (ii) the energy industries are operating in more remote and environmentally pristine (e.g the Arctic) regions? The course will consider the different legal instruments and traditions for regulating disaster risk and the particular impact which this has on the energy sector. In addition, the course will discuss the contribution which environmental law makes to disaster risk reduction and what are the optimal legal standards for disaster prevention and risk reduction. Finally, the course will consider the law’s various responses to disasters and how, in the field of energy, the costs of risk reduction and disaster remediation are allocated between the public and private sectors and between the developed and developing world."
"Hong Kong is an international financial centre because it has an active market for trade in securities. Securities include shares of stock, debt instruments and derivative products. One important type of derivative product is a futures contract based on commodities, which can potentially include fossil fuels and energy contracts. Securities markets concentrate the contracting of orders to trade in securities and facilitate the transfer of both assets traded and the funds paid for such assets. Exchanges designed for such trading attempt to lower counterparty, operational and delivery risk, as well as the Alpha risk associated with issuers.Because securities markets are infrastructure designed to allow contracting and property transfer while achieving regulatory goals, they are a primary point of intersection between law, market forces, and technology (recently called 'fintech'). This course will examine the growth of securities markets in Hong Kong against the theoretical backdrop of market structure and quality, addressing recent important topics like high frequency trading, dark pools, distributed ledger technology ('blockchain') and the dramatic growth of available derivatives products and their trading on the markets. Special attention will be given to development of markets in fossil fuels and energy contracts."
"China is the world’s biggest consumer and producer of energy. The energy industry is one of the largest sectors in China and China’s electric power industry alone spends approximately USD $116 billion per year on new investments, including generation (both conventional and clean energy types), transmission and distribution facilities. The regulation of the energy industry in China is complex and enforced by a variety of governmental agencies. Adequate, reliable and sustainable supplies of energy are crucial to China’s economy and their assurance demands continuous development and improvement of the relevant laws and regulatory systems. Chinese energy law is continually evolving to respond to national development priorities and international law development, such as sector reform and liberalisation, and regulatory concerns over environmental impact and greenhouse gas emissions. The area of energy law in China is of increasing importance for both legal practitioners and relevant stakeholders in the public sector and in the industry.This course will provide an introduction to energy law and regulation in China with a focus on the governance and regulatory systems that underlie each type of energy supply, such electricity, coal, oil and gas. Attention will be devoted to the green economic transition and its associated legal and regulatory systems in China, including renewable energy law, energy efficiency regulation and energy conservation law. The regulatory issues surrounding China’s outbound energy investment and some emerging regulatory issues in China’s energy sector, such as shale gas, electric vehicles and third party access to the pipelines, will also be addressed. The objective of this course is to develop students’ knowledge and understanding of Chinese energy law and regulation so that they are trained to apply the knowledge tools to practice, such as advising clients in power purchase agreement and assisting their low carbon investments."
"This course will study how decision-makers allocate and protect water resources, the world’s most crucial natural resource. The emphasis will be on current legal and policy debates, although we will also examine the history of water development and politics. The course will focus on international water law, but will also touch upon regional and domestic law and policy on water governance in the discussion of the themes and issues. Insights are drawn from water regimes throughout the world. Water issues considered are: how to allocate water during periods of scarcity (particularly as climate change leads to more extremes); alternative means of responding to the world’s growing demands for water (including active conservation, water treatment and recycling); the appropriate role for the market and private companies in meeting society’s water needs; protection of threatened groundwater resources; environmental limits on water development (including the UN Biodiversity Convention; The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance Especially as Waterfowl Habitat); constitutional issues in water governance; the human right to water; indigenous water rights; protection of water quality; challenges to the substantive reform of existing water law; and inter-state and international disputes over water. Students will be expected to participate actively in classroom discussions.This course equips students with understanding, knowledge and skills of water law principles, issues, dilemmas and challenges of water managers to participate in a game of water conflict, negotiation and diplomacy. This will enhance students’ understanding of water law in practice, and all themes will be discussed with reference to implications for China."
"This course provides students an overview of the development of law in world history. It considers major moments in the distant past as well as the recent history of law from around the world. It will also explore various manners in which different areas of law have evolved and developed, as well as the manner in which recent centuries have seen increasing dissemination, imposition, imitation, importation, and convergence between legal systems globally. Among other topics, the course will explore the place of law in ancient societies, law and religion, the ideas of natural law and legal positivism, law as a medium of commercial exchange between polities, law and property, law and the state, legal pluralism, and the manners in which law evolved in the nineteenth century in general and in the context of empire in particular. It will reflect on the different functions law can play and does play in society, the various manners in which legal orders have evolved over time, both substantively and institutionally, and the underlying factors that have driven the evolution of law and legal systems over time. The course will also provide students with an introduction to the basics of legal history methodology."
"This course will provide students the opportunity to develop their independent research projects. The primary component of the course will be writing a 15,000-28,000 word independent research paper.The paper will be written under the supervision of a faculty member, selected by the student, subject to that faculty’s member’s agreement. In addition to evaluating the final paper, the faculty member will help the student develop her/his research question(s), and will provide feedback on at least one substantial draft of the paper in progress.In addition, the course will also involve a bi-weekly seminar. Over the course of the semester, each student will present their work in progress, and will receive comments from the course convenor as well as from their fellow students. Other faculty members, including students’ supervisors, may be invited to these presentations as well. The course convenor will provide additional instruction, feedback and discussion on legal history methodology during the seminar sessions.

"This course deals with the main rules and principles regulating torts in Hong Kong. By incorporating a more extended range of mandatory readings than undergraduate courses of similar length and a more research-focused assessment regime, this course is designed specifically for students at the postgraduate level who have not previously studied the law of tort as it applies in a common law jurisdiction. Torts are legally enforceable civil obligations that do not depend on any prior agreement between the parties. They are among the most frequently encountered legal issues in daily life. As with the law regulating contracts, the law regulating torts is a principal foundation of the common law. Throughout the course students will be expected to evaluate and discuss the part played by torts in maintaining and promoting (i) social and economic order, and (ii) responsible and respectful conduct, based on the community’s own customs, traditions, and expectations. Students will also be further introduced to the common law’s methods, techniques, and core values while developing their problem-solving, research, writing, and information literacy skills to a level appropriate for postgraduate studies. Topics covered include: the scope of tort law and general principles of liability; negligence (standard of care, duty of care including pure economic loss and nervous shock, causation and remoteness, defences, contributory negligence); assessment of damages for personal injuries; employers’ liability for injuries to employees; vicarious liability; strict liability and the rule in Rylands v Fletcher; occupiers’ liability; defamation; breach of statutory duty; nuisance; trespass (to persons, to land, to goods); detinue; conversion; defences to intentional torts; and remedies for intentional torts."
"This course assists students to develop a plan for their theses, its methodology and argumentation structure. Skills such as traditional research and database searching are cultivated.

"This course is designed to assist Research Postgraduate students at approximately the mid-way point during the development of their thesis. After their first year, they will have already done much research and thought about the general components of their thesis. Their second year will be a spring-board for writing in their 3rd (and in some cases, 4th) years. Students will be expected to complete a series of short writing assignments focusing on academic writing (and in some cases, related to their Master’s/doctoral research) with a view to having them develop a range of tools to help them during drafting of the thesis. Through interactive workshops and small group discussion, students will be expected to engage constructively in critique and feedback on their own and colleagues’ work. In addition to developing writing skills and discovering their individual academic voice, students will develop a sense of different academic writing conventions and will be able to distinguish between and draft the thesis and academic articles (which, to the extent it does not interfere with their thesis research and writing, they may wish to write during their years as Master’s/doctoral students)."
This course equips research postgraduate students (RPg students) with the skills and the necessary confidence to engage in law school classroom teaching as well as to reflect critically and constructively upon that teaching. The course is mandatory for all new RPg students and voluntary for existing RPg students and staff members.
"In this course, a research postgraduate student will, under the supervision and with the support and monitoring of his or her supervisor, design, plan, research and write his or her thesis. A student is required to meet with his or her supervisor regularly, and the supervisor will provide the necessary guidance for the student to write the thesis and monitor the student’s academic progress. The student is expected to set milestones for the completion of the thesis and to regularly update the supervisor on progress, both in terms of research and writing. The student and supervisor shall agree to a work plan during the first term of the course, and in order to satisfactory pass the course the student is expected to meet the targets set out in the work plan, regularly produce drafts of chapters for review and respond positively to suggestions proffered by the supervisor."
