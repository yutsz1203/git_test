"A group of students work on an innovative and entrepreneurial idea (a product, a venture or a service) which shows promise in bringing practical social benefits to the community. The idea should be feasible, sustainable, and promising in terms of improving social well-being. Each group should consist of students from diverse backgrounds. Students may form their own groups. Students will work under the supervision of an instructor, who guides the students from the creation of an idea to the writing and presentation of a proposal and/or action plan. Performance throughout the work process is graded. Advisory: For Final Year College students only."
