The course will go through the steps in designing research topic and questions, searching and reviewing relevant literature, formulating research hypotheses, identifying suitable research tools and sampling methods, analyzing and interpreting research findings and writing up research reports with students. Students will also learn the principles of research ethics and procedures in obtaining ethics clearance at CUHK."
"Educational innovation can be found in processes, services, programmes and partnerships. Educational innovation improves teaching and learning, enhances wellbeing, ensures successful transitions and pathways, as well as alleviates inequity. This course will start with an introduction on the role of education in economic development followed by discussion on various forms of educational innovation in schooling systems including alternative schools. Case studies on innovative educational practice in different countries will be examined. Students will be asked to identify educational challenges that learners and teachers are grappling with. Guest lectures are offered by leaders of local or international social enterprises and foundations that practice and support educational innovations. Students will be invited to brainstorm and join social enterprises’ efforts to provide sustainable strategies to tackle development issues especially to that of educational equality. Evaluation on how educational innovations promote student learning will also be explored. At the end of the course, students will develop a proposal that advances current educational practices in our society reflecting community needs and addressing the social inequality and poverty issues."
"This course provides an introductory survey of the links between education, technological advancement and human development in the globe. While digital and technological innovation accelerates economic growth and plays a critical role for reducing poverty, it also trigger social inequality issues.
