"This course aims to introduce a range of basic topics related to otorhinolaryngology and communication sciences. Students will gain understanding of the epidemiological and clinical issues of various otorhinolaryngology, head and neck and communication-related diseases and disorders."
"Communication chain is a model incorporating the essential characteristics of behavioral and medical models to describe the processes involved in human communication. Stages within the communication chain includes prelinguistic, language decoding, motor programming, motor execution, transmission, reception, perception, language decoding and message interpretation. This course aims at introducing each stage in relation to the anatomical structures, neurological function, physiological function and the resultant behaviors. Breakdown in any stage leading to various disorders relating to speech, language or hearing will be described. Clinical data will be used as case studies for illustrations. In addition, mechanisms of swallowing and dysphagia will be covered."
"The speech, language, and hearing sciences are often described as inter-disciplinary subjects, which are partly related to psychology. This course aims at giving an overview of psychology, as a systematic and scientific study of behaviours and mental processes, from the perspectives of the speech, language, and hearing sciences. The applications of psychology, including the role of mental functions in individual and social behaviour, the physiological and biological processes underlying cognitive functions and behaviours, will be introduced in the context of communication disorders and sciences."
"This course will focus on specific topics and advanced issues related to otorhinolaryngology, head and neck surgery and communication sciences. These topics will reflect academic needs/interests, faculty expertise and student’s needs. Students are allowed to take this course more than once, and gain the units each time they pass the course. However, students cannot take the course under the same topic twice."
