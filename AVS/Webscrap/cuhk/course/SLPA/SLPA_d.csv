"This course covers children's acquisition of speech, articulatory foundations of speech, transcription of speech and classification and causes of speech sound disorders. The course will introduce students to the different types of speech sound disorders, differentiating between those involving phonology (e.g. phonological impairment) and those related to motor speech (e.g. articulation impairment). Students will also be exposed to person-centred functional goals directly addressing the WHO ICF (International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health) framework. The range of treatment approaches will be taught with an emphasis on evidence-based treatment approaches for the different types of SSD. Teaching and learning enhancement techniques will include case studies, videos and role play/simulations."
"The course will cover craniofacial conditions, focusing on cleft lip and palate and craniofacial dysostosis.Students will learn how to undertaken a comprehensive perceptual assessment of cleft palate speech and velopharyngeal dysfunction using a standardized speech sampling protocol and listening protocol. Students will be exposed to treatment of cleft palate speech from early intervention to adulthood. The course will also cover instrumental assessment of cleft palate speech and velopharyngeal function. Students will also be exposed to primary and secondary (velopharyngeal) surgery in this client population and the inter-professional working paradigm within a cranofacial clinical service."
"This course will cover the fundamental audiological evaluations as well as a brief introduction on more advanced approaches. Students will learn about interpretation of audiological reports, major principles of speech perception assessment and various approaches of aural (re)habilitation for populations ranging from infants to older adults."
"This course aims to provide students with the fundamental knowledge of swallowing, dysphagia assessment and management. This course aims to equip students with entry-level skills to assess and manage dysphagia across all age range, in particular the adult population."
"This course aims to provide students with more in-depth knowledge of swallowing, dysphagia assessment and management. This course aims to equip students with entry-level knowledge on instrumental assessment such as Fibreoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES), Videofluoroscopic Swallow Study (VFSS) and ultrasound. It also equips students with knowledge of dysphagia in special populations such as patients with tracheostomy."
"The course provides students with comprehensive knowledge of paediatric feeding and swallowing assessment and management. Content of anatomy, normal development, paediatric neurodevelopment and aero-digestive system, clinical swallowing and feeding assessment, and management will be covered. Through a combination of lectures, team-based learning, case studies, and practical exercises, students will develop a deep understanding of the complexities surrounding paediatric feeding and swallowing disorders and acquire the necessary skills to assess and manage these conditions effectively."
"This course aims to prepare students to manage complex cases as an entry-level speech language pathologist. Clinical management is more complex not only when clients/patients are presented with competing communication and swallowing needs but also when their conditions interact with other challenges, such as cultural, moral, ethical, legal, and service delivery issues etc.This course adopts a team-based learning approach to allow students to reflect, discuss and problem solve to generate clinical decisions on various complex case scenarios.  Students are required to integrate the knowledge they acquired on a range of practice areas in speech language pathology while considering issues including but not limited to medical ethics, evidence-based practice, ICF model, person-centered care, interprofessional collaborative practice and culturally responsive practice."
"The course is designed to provide students with basic clinical skills to prepare for clinical practice. Students will acquire basic and generic clinical skills in relation to speech language pathology through seminars, workshops, and simulated learning."
"The course is designed to provide students with experiential learning for them to develop the required clinical skills in managing clients with various communication disorders. Students will be trained to manage, under supervision, paediatric and adult clients in various settings including clinics, schools, health care organizations, and hospitals."

"This course introduces students to a unified approach to language as a complex structure represented in the minds of its speakers. Empirical linguistic data will be drawn across languages to enable students to understand the intimate relation between language and the human mind. On the basis of this understanding, students are led to explore the core areas of linguistics. The exploration starts with natural language sound systems and phonological components of grammar. These will be explained with basic concepts and recent theoretical advances in linguistic studies alongside new findings in language acquisition. Students will learn to apply these concepts and ideas to tackle linguistic problems."
"Taking a modular approach to the language system, this course examines the morphological, semantic and syntactic components of the grammar, as well as the interaction among them. The lectures are intended to provide students with a solid grounding in basic linguistic concepts, which will enable them to tackle linguistic problems, and formulate their own analyses to prepare them for further studies in the discipline. A wide range of data will be discussed to develop students’ sensitivity toward linguistic phenomena with systematic properties in form, meaning and structure."
"The acquisition of first language by children has been considered a remarkable feat. How do children accomplish this feat so rapidly and effortlessly? What are the stages they go through in mastering the different aspects of language? What does the development of language in children tell us about the human language faculty? These questions will be examined in light of modern linguistic theory, and nativist and interactionist accounts will be compared. Topics in second language acquisition will also be covered. Questions such as how interlanguage grammars develop in adults and the role of the mother tongue in the construction of interlanguage grammar will be addressed."
