"This course is divided into two main parts. The first part is focused on the application of the philosophy of science to behavioral research in business. Basic concepts such as explanation, scientific laws, and theory are introduced and discussed. The second part provides an introduction to the various stages of scientific research which include research design, measurement scale and development, sampling design, data collection and statistical analysis. Even though mathematical proofs and statistical derivations will be reduced to a minimum, having the knowledge of basic statistics and matrix manipulations will be helpful."
"This course is the continuation of BASA6001. The course covers concepts and techniques related to behavioral experiment. In particular, students will learn how to apply various types of behavioral research design and statistical methods, and how to analyze and interpret the results. Sample topics include among others experimental design, significance tests , statistical power, interaction and moderating effects, testing of psychological mechanism. This course does not involve mathematical proofs or statistical derivations. Good knowledge of basic statistics is essential. Prerequisite: BASA6001"
