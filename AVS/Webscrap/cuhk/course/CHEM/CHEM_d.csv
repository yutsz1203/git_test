"Catalysis is a cutting-edge science and plays a central role in modern organic synthesis. Enjoying the modification of the ligand, the activity of the transition metal complex can be manipulated to fit specific catalysis. This course will give students an in-depth understanding of catalyst structures via organometallic and organic chemistry approaches, and how those catalysts (d-block transition metal complexes) can be applied in sustainable and complex chemical synthesis. The industrial applications of some tailor-made catalysts will also be discussed. In this course, student presentation of current frontier catalysis is required."
"The aim of this course is to provide students with comprehensive knowledge of synthetic methods in organic chemistry and deeper understanding of factors that control reactions and product formations. Details in retrosynthetic analysis, modern synthetic tools, named organic reactions and natural product synthesis will be discussed. Specific topics including oxidation, reduction, olefination, protecting groups, functional groups interconversion, carbonyl chemistry, cycloaddition, rearrangement and organometallic reagents will be covered."
"This course provides an overview of fundamental concepts and essential applications of supramolecular chemistry. This course covers two parts. The first part focuses on the fundamental concepts, including a brief history of supramolecular chemistry, characterization of supramolecular systems, noncovalent interactions and ion binding, templated synthesis and self-assembly as well as inclusion complexes. The second part focuses on the application of supramolecular chemistry, discussing selected supramolecular systems and introducing important examples of applying supramolecular chemistry in materials sciences and biology."
Talks given by invited speakers covering recent progress in chemical sciences.
"This course offers postgraduate students who are interested in the research at the interface between chemistry and biology in-depth knowledge about chemical biology. The course has three modules. Module 1 covers the chemical structures, reactions, synthesis, and functions of biomolecules. The lecturer will first introduce four types of biomolecules, namely peptides and proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids to chemistry students, with a focus on their molecular structures, higher-order structures and organizations, and the organic reactions to synthesize or to transform these molecules in a synthetic laboratory or inside cells. The course will also focus on the functions that the structures and reactivities of the biomolecules encode. Enzymes, a special group of proteins will also be introduced to the audience, together with cofactors and coenzymes as one example of proteins possessing catalytic power. Module 2 will include current technologies developed in chemical biology, and selected research projects in this field, including literature review and guest lectures based on the knowledge delivered in the first two parts. Module 3 will be guest lectures in chemical biology. Through this course, students will be able to apply their chemistry knowledge to complicated biological molecules, to comprehend chemical biology research, and to identify/solve chemical biology problems."
"This course aims to provide students with the fundamental concepts and applications of mass spectrometry. It consists of several core modules including desorption/ionization techniques, ion activation methods, mass analysers and ion detectors. The use of mass spectrometry methods for structural elucidation of small organic molecules. Theory of unimolecular decomposition and simple mass spectral interpretation will be taught. Biological applications of mass spectrometry, including genomic, proteomic and glycomic applications, will also be taught. Through the guided literature reviews and presentations, postgraduate students will have a better understanding on the extended applications of mass spectrometry, including protein conformation analysis and mass spectrometry imaging."
"This course reviews analytical methods to solve biological problems. It serves as a primer to the expanding field of bioanalysis. The topics covered by this course include: purification and separation, spectroscopic methods; eletrophoresis; mass spectroscopy; chromatography; NMR; analysis of nucleic acids; nucleic acid and protein sequencing; immunoanalysis, single molecule techniques; single cell analysis; biochips; etc."
"Electrochemistry is playing a more and more important role in the application of renewable energy. This course will cover the theory and practice of a broad spectrum in electrochemistry especially inelectrochemical energy storage and conversion systems. It will provide a brief introduction to the basic chemistry and physics concepts in electrochemistry. The further application in electrocatalysis,batteries, fuel cells, super capacitors and electrochemical synthesis will also be introduced."
