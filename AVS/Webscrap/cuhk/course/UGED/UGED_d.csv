"This course introduces students to jazz music and its connections to both African-American culture and global social-historical contexts. The first half of the semester focuses on the development of jazz in the United States, surveying the rise of the music as an African-American art form over the course of the twentieth century, with attention to blues, ragtime, swing, bebop, modal jazz, free jazz, and fusion. The second half of the semester considers jazz as a transnationally circulating cultural form that is both a product of and a contributor to globalizing trends, examining jazz’s circulations and permutations in contexts ranging from 1930s Shanghai to present-day West Africa. Through this course, students will gain a familiarity with the history of jazz, some of its major innovators, and its musical characteristics. Critical and close listening will be an important aspect of this course; through in-depth audition and discussion of musical examples, students will gain aural skills that increase their appreciation and understanding of jazz music. At the same time, by examining jazz in relation to issues including race, ethnicity, political consciousness, globalization, and economics, students will develop skills in thinking critically about music’s connections to social, cultural, and historical contexts. No musical background or previous study of music is required."
"This course equips the students the aesthetics to consider how sound and music contribute towards the overall impact on screen production. The course will focus on the 10-year of the movies of the Marvel Studio as the model, which is typical 21st Century Hollywood style, to learn about the use of sound and music in motion picture and television productions; the course will explore and demonstrate sound and music integral in the creative of screen production and can significantly affect intended result. Students will be trained to have greater appreciation of the roles and functions of screen sound design, music and compositional styles; at the same time through the view of music, psychology and Sociology, to understand musical symbolism and the usage of it, as well as the social impact."
"How does the music work in Broadway shows? How does music interact with the plot and drama? How are megamusicals like Phantom of the Opera and Les Misérables different from the other musicals? What can we listen for to enhance our appreciation for musicals? This course explores different perspectives of studying and appreciating the musical arts of the modern musical theatre, covering areas such as analyses of the musical elements, storytelling through motifs and themes, aesthetics and criticism, as well as gender issues, politics, and other realms of contextual studies. Examples will be drawn from the Broadway musicals since the 1950s, musical films, as well as examples from the western classical tradition if deemed necessary. Active, analytical, and critical listening will be integral to understanding the materials and concepts in this class. Students are expected and encouraged to practice active listening and analysis beyond the classroom setting. No previous experience is required. This course is not for music majors."
"In the West, Beethoven is widely regarded as the greatest composer in the history of music and even of mankind. The stories of Beethoven’s broken family, failed love-life, and hearing loss have enthralled Western audiences as much as the sounds of his piano sonatas, string quartets, and symphonies. When the Berlin Wall was demolished in 1989, it was accompanied by Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy.” Yet, despite Western claims to Beethoven’s universality, nowhere else in the non-Western world is Beethoven held in such esteem–except for China. Since the late (if not even early) twentieth century, Beethoven has had more admirers in China than in the West. Who exactly is this Beethoven? And how was it that he, an Austro-German composer who read into Hinduism but never (so far is as currently known) into Confucianism, became a cultural icon both for and of the Chinese? Scholars still just do not know. In this course, we will try to figure it out for ourselves. By listening to and viewing Beethoven’s masterworks and hearing/seeing them in both their original Western and Chinese contexts, we will debate what makes this one person collectively Western, Chinese, and universal (or not). In addition to listening and reading assignments, students will research an independent essay/concert review on Beethoven and his music, whether in Greater China, the West, or both. The abilities to read or hear music are not required to excel in this class."

"Success is defined as the accomplishment of an aim or purpose. This definition implies that successful individuals engage in purposeful, agentic pursuits. Success in attaining task goals confers a feeling of competence; success in reaching relationship goals gives one a feeling of acceptance. Both feelings are major ingredients of mental health. Success in attaining valued goals requires the abilities to adapt to change. These abilities include openness to diverse ideas, cognitive flexibility, creativity, emotional stability, motivation and perseverance. Behavioural research has shown that success is more likely among people who possess several self-attributes. In this course, we will empower students with theoretical and empirical knowledge of these attributes, and engage them in weekly experiential activities, through which they will develop and weave these self-attributes into their daily goal pursuits. Through the use of a self-assessment online platform, student will track their personal growth in these self-attributes. Major aspects of the successful self that will be covered in this course are: the rational self, veridical self-knowledge, the transcendent self, the socially intelligent self, the loved self, the multicultural self, and the global self.This course is closely related to the SDG subgoal of promoting mental health and well-being. First, psychological well-being ensues from attaining one's valued goals. In addition, feeling competent and feeling accepted are two pillars of psychological maturity and mental health. In this course, students will learn the concepts and practical skills that would enable students to more effectively attain their valued goal, and feel competent and accepted."

"(UGED1602 is double-coded with SOWK1130.) Death is not special. It happens every day and everywhere. It is also an inevitable part of life. Yet, death is very important for us especially when we are confronted by the death and dying of our loved ones. Surprisingly, we have done little to prepare ourselves to get familiar with the topic of bereavement. Very often we learn it only from the most painful and heartbreaking moments in life—after the death of loved ones. While bereavement may induce us different grief reactions, and adjustment difficulties, it also provides an opportunity for us to experience personal growth, reflect on our values and search for the meaning in life. As a result, this course aims to prepare students to face death, dying and bereavement that they may encounter in their life. In particular, they are facilitated to respond to a unique question, “How can I live with the grief?” This question can only be answered by the students themselves who will have an opportunity to understand more about death, dying and bereavement, as well as reflecting on their life and living through this course."

"(UGED2187 is double-coded with ENGE2140.) This course aims to provide a historical and cultural overview of the genre of superheroes and the Marvel empire. Narratives of superheroes began to circulate in popular culture during the 1930s with the DC comics phenomenon. The visual artistry and matching of illustrations with text and plot produced a uniquely new form of weekly reading material. The development of the DC and Marvel superheroes of the 80s and 90s built on Asian illustrated traditions and forged new relationships between East and West comics and graphics styles. Today, the genre is among the most dominant cultural forms worldwide. This course will introduce you to the comics and graphic novel literary genre and their movie spin-offs. The course will also have a workshop element and seek graphic and illustrated responses from students. Above all, the course will investigate the role of the superhero. Who is this superhero, or rather what is a superhero? Why does the fantasy of an individual with supernatural powers generate such fascination in modern society? These are some of the questions we will explore during this course. The genre’s transformations over the last nine decades reflect both political, cultural, and social changes. We will explore a broad variety of different superhero incarnations in both film, texts, and graphic novels. Subjects to be discussed include mythology, genre, science and technology, crime and vigilantism, identity, gender and sexuality as well as transnationalism and geopolitics. Anyone interested in popular culture, animation, DC comics, the graphic novel, fantasy and superheroes are welcome to attend this course."

The study material for this course will consist of literary texts, TV series, and films drawn from the popular cultural canon. Topics we will discuss include conspiracy, serial crime, trauma, the epistemology of clues, history and crime, and the criminal mind. The course begins with a historical overview of detective fiction, and concludes with a creative workshop on how to write a detective story. Students with a taste for murder, crime, and suspense — and above all the desire to solve enigmas and mysteries — are welcome to attend this course."
"(UGED2197 is double-coded with ENGE2190.) The course will consider myths and legends from around the world with particular sensitivity to one peculiar aspect of them: that the gods depicted in them often behave no better than the people whose lives they determine. In order to explain why this is the case, the course will seek to understand the nature and function of myth, and the complex uses to which they are put in order to explain some of our most pressing questions: How did we all begin? Where are we? Who are we? Why is there so much wrong with the world? What’s the solution? Where will we go when we die? How will it all end? Although the concept of myth might seem outdated in modern secular culture, by drawing comparisons between the ancient and contemporary worlds, students will be encouraged to see how myth-making of some kind is as inevitable and innately human as the questions which prompt it. The course will begin by establishing some archetypal similarities between myths – from myths of Creation to myths of Apocalypse – and then consider myths from specific cultures – including Greco-Roman, Scandinavian, and Chinese – before considering the appeal of myth in contemporary popular culture, especially The Lord of Rings, and Game of Thrones."
"(UGED2199 is double-coded with ENGE2210.) This course takes a closer look at the intimate connections between song and poetry. The history of song has always been closely connected with the oral tradition in literature; conversely, the musicality of literature owes much to the song tradition. Gospel, Negro Spirituals, Folk Music, the Bard Tradition, the Sean Nós tradition, the ballad and the lyric form in poetry, as well as popular music and musicals will all be examined in this course. The course will examine the different song traditions in their social and political contexts. The course will also include a song-writing element. There will be a song-writing workshop with a well-known local songwriter. Students will be asked to write a song in any genre of their choice (folk song, protest song, spiritual song etc.) and then to have that song performed either by themselves or someone else in the class.

"(UGED2285 is double-coded with CUMT2004.) This is a cross-disciplinary course straddles the studies of history, anthropology, and sociology from the perspective of material objects. The course intends to achieve two goals: first, it leads students to identify and appreciate the traditional Chinese values, which include the teachings of Confucianism and Daoism, embodied in the many production types pertinent to what we now regard as Chinese; and second, it explains how those various material types ended up being included and translated as the representative categories of Chinese civilization throughout the historical times. The course will begin from the basic by introducing the mainstream material productions from ancient to modern China: jades, antique bronzes, lacquer, ceramics, architecture, silk, as well as grave goods. The discussions instruct students to appreciate these essential elements of Chinese culture from the perspectives of their physical qualities, craftsmanship, and historical values. They are also to encourage students to think about the roles of material objects in shaping cultural, ethnic, and even national identities."
"(UGED2286 is double-coded with CUMT2006.) The exhibition has become a site of knowledge production and a prominent and diverse part of contemporary culture. Regarding “Chinese art” as a social constructed concept, the course uses “exhibition” as an entry point to engage with issues concerning Chinese art and to explore the role played by exhibitions in the formation of the knowledge of Chinese art. It introduces the current theories and debates on the theory and history of exhibition, and the display methods, examining the changing concept of Chinese art and curatorial practices through detailed analysis of case studies. The first part of the course traces the formation of the concept of “Chinese art” by looking closely at the history of exhibitions on Chinese objects from the late Qing dynasty to the early twentieth century. The second part examines important exhibitions that have shaped our understanding of Chinese art. Structured thematically, the course discusses the curatorial concepts of selective significant international exhibitions on Chinese art, and investigate how scholarly research has been transformed into exhibitions which have shaped our understanding of Chinese art, constructed identity and been deployed for political ends."
"Each day, our life is flooded with thoughts and emotions aroused by noises outside and inside of us. Do these thoughts and emotions support the real purpose of our life, bringing fulfillment and happiness? Or do they make our life an endless cycle of stress, anger, fear, and even hopelessness? The course offers an orientation into mindfulness meditation as a possible way of “resetting,” at personal and inter-personal levels. Emphasis is on reflective participation, supplemented by knowledge of basic concepts and principles.From the formal practice of sitting cross-legged and quietly counting the breaths to the informal practice of embracing each moment in daily life, students will be guided to cultivate samma sati, or “right mindfulness,” one of the Eightfold Paths to end suffering. Mindfulness meditation (MM) is grounded in ancient Buddhist sutras named Anapanasati (“mindfulness breathing”) and Satipatthana (“foundation of mindfulness”) and 2,500 years of lay and monastic practice. It aims for the practitioner to develop one-pointed concentration on the body, feelings, mind, and dharmas (phenomena), and thereby to reflect on their impermanence, comprehend no-self, and cultivate loving kindness. Over the past decades, a whole range of secular mindfulness practices, or mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), have emerged to serve therapeutic and educational purposes. Students may also explore one or more of such modern applications, and ponder the contribution of mindfulness training to good health and well-being (Sustainable Development Goal 3), and to Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) as a whole.The course will take students on a one-week retreat in a Buddhist meditation centre, preceded by readings and presentations on relevant topics, and followed by a personal reflection and a mini-research on the experience. Through undisturbed practice of mindfulness meditation away from home and along with peers and monastics, students will master the basic skills of the formal practice and begin to develop a habit of mindful living. Hopefully, they will cultivate a sense of self-compassion and connectedness with fellow human beings that fosters emotion management, harmonious relation and wise social action."
"(UGED2306 is double-coded with FAAS2110.) This course aims at exploring the relationship between Chinese art and religion from the Shang period onwards. Students will be introduced to religious paintings, buildings, sculptures, clothes and ritual objects. Through studying important archaeological and extant religious artifacts and recent research on Chinese religious beliefs, students are expected to understand the characteristics and significance of Chinese religious arts. Religious ideas behind different forms of art will also be discussed."
"(UGED2315 is double-coded with FAAS2113.) The survey introduces the art and material culture of pre-20th century Asia with particular attention paid to trans-regional and cross-cultural interactions. Select artistic traditions in West (mainly, Iran), South (India, Sri Lanka, and the Himalayas), Southeast (Indonesia, Burma, Thai, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam), and Inner (Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Mongolia) will be examined against their philosophical, religious, socio-political, economic, aesthetic, and technological backgrounds. Major themes include (1) the rise of civilizations, (2) developments of various artistic forms and media, (3) tombs and funerary paraphernalia, (4) the spread of Buddhism, Hinduism, Islamism, and other worldviews across the region, and (5) Indianization and Sinicization."
"(UGED2316 is double-coded with FAAS2100.)  In the traditional discourse of Chinese painting, it was believed that an artist should “外師造化，中得心源” (outwardly learn from the Nature and inwardly trace the source of their own heart). Unfortunately, with the enormous temporal and geographical difference, both the Nature and the “heart-source” of the ancient masters, as well as their techniques in articulating the two, appear to be unapproachable to us living in the modern age. Likewise, the field’s ambiguous meta-language full of expressions like “氣韻生動” (infusing ch’i to show life movement) or “意趣” (subtle charm resulted from spontaneity) can also be a hurdle to uninitiated students.Distant it might seem, art, after all, is inspired by real life. This course seeks to explore the material basis of the Nature artistically heightened by the ancient artists directed by their “heart-source”. We would try to explore the abstract philosophical ideas and aesthetic ideals by looking at something physical and concrete: by visiting specific scenic sites, we would be able to compare the landscape with the paintings they inspired and have more idea on how the visual vocabulary and grammar of Chinese painting “translates” the real world; and by viewing the objects, or even experience some of the activities central to the artists’ cultural life, students would also have a more substantial understanding on the “heart-source” of these painters.This course would use the Songjiang and Wu Schools of painting as case studies. A field trip will be organized and students will be walked through the areas of Shanghai, Suzhou and Hangzhou where the Ming Dynasty painters were active in. Through the well-preserved tangible heritage of the region, students could have a better feeling of the intangible ideational world of the ancient masters and their artistic pursuits. The endeavours of the local communities in preserving these invaluable treasures will also be reviewed."
"This course is a philosophical discussion of the idea of happiness. The first part covers major theories of happiness from Western and Chinese tradition. The second part deals with the theoretical issues of happiness: the definition of happiness; distinction between pleasure, happiness, and unhappiness; attainability of happiness; hedonism and eudaemonism; and the meaning of happiness in the contemporary world."
"(UGED2326 is double-coded with CURE2051.)  Nowadays comic strip has become one of the major forms of visual narratives in our culture. Both comics and film are visual arts originally developed within the period of late 19th century and early 20th century. Although film has long ago established its artistic legitimacy, comic art still struggle for recognition. However, as Will Eisner put it, comic strip is a “Sequential Art” and has its own unique aesthetic nature. This course tries to inquire the governing aesthetic principles of comics and investigate its unique method of expression. We will also try to delineate the special communication mode of comics and its relationship with different aspects of modern society and culture. Students will learn to appreciate comic art from different perspectives, and strengthen analytical skills for visual media."
"""The Book of Changes"" (Yijing) is a highly venerated and influential classic that has made far-reaching impacts on the Chinese religion, philosophy, politics and medicine. It has a far greater significance for the Chinese culture as a book of wisdom than a divination manual, by offering a wealth of knowledge and insights about the cosmos, nature, and life. It shows us the ways to cultivate virtue, enhance ability and perceive wisdom by living our lives and making judgments in harmony with the changing forces of the universe. The store of ancient wisdom accumulated in this classic is often still relevant to our contemporary world that is in constant and rapid technological, social and political changes. Through guided reading of the key notions and themes encapsulated in some selected hexagrams, students may draw from the wellspring of profound wisdom in the ""The Book of Changes"" to stimulate their reflection on the approach of life, the way of looking at the world, and the recurring issues facing humanity."
"The spread of Buddhism in China has a long history. The incorporation of Buddhism into Chinese culture marked a great success in intercultural dialogue, as the Chinese adopted and modified teachings and wisdom transmitted into Chinese philosophical wisdom. Buddhism adopts a negative approach of understanding human existence, but its final aim is to transcend nihilism.

"(UGED2622 is double-coded with ANTH2530.)  This course examines the pervasiveness of violence from an anthropological and comparative perspective. We consider a wide range of phenomena that can be called violence within diverse historical and cultural contexts. Violence is always political – whether it is manifest in the spectacular practices of torture, terrorism, or genocide, or the invisible structures of inequalities that generate educational, health, and food inequities. Specifically, we will address four SDG goals in depth: SDG#1 No Poverty, SDG #5 “Gender Equality”, SDG# 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth, SDG #10 “Reduced Inequalities” and SDG #16 “Peace, Justice and strong institutions”; The topics covered will be understood in relation to histories of colonialism and nationalism, ideologies about race, gender, and variant forms of social, economic, and political hierarchies. We further examine the effectiveness and limitations of human rights and humanitarianism as remedies, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."
"(UGED2637 is double-coded with COMM2930.) This course aims at helping students to earn a solid vocabulary and a sharp eye in analyzing films. Students will learn about the basic cinematic techniques and structures, including mise-en-scene and montage, use of cinematic time and space, the image, soundtrack, and the script. Theoretical perspectives such as realism, feminism, postmodernism would be introduced to address the political, economic and socio-cultural implications of movies. Equipped with these analytical tools, students can critically appreciate movies of different era and different places."
"This course aims to inquire into the essence of human existence and its close connection with values consciousness, in order to see that values education is necessary to be ""truly human"". The contents of the course include reflection on the conditions of human existence in the process of industrialization and globalization and investigation of various conceptions of human existence, such as in Materialism, Evolutionism, Freud, Christianity, Existentialism, Kant and Confucianism. The course concludes that the essence of human existence resides in human subjectivity and values consciousness. Based on such contentions, it will examine the meaning and types of values, and pinpoint the importance of values education to elevate the consciousness of students. Finally it inquires into the meaning of values education and the essence of Aesthetic Education, Religious Education and especially Moral Education in order to recognise their importance in making people ""truly human""."
"(UGED2666 is double-coded with ANTH2360.) This course introduces students to the study of morality and ethics from a social and cross-cultural perspective. Morality and ethics became a distinct area for anthropological inquiry as recently as the beginning of the 21st century. Why this topic is relatively new in anthropology has something to do with the way in which moral differences have been conflated with cultural differences in the history of the discipline. In other words, anthropologists have long presumed that differences between right and wrong, good and bad, are culturally constructed. In recent years, however, this conflation has been questioned and problematized, with reference to the problem of competing moral goods within a single society and the role of the individual in negotiating moral commitments. Having much to say about cultural differences as well as contingent social processes, anthropologists are now in an even better position to contribute to cross-disciplinary conversations about the nature of morality and ethics. By exploring morality and ethics from a social and cross-cultural perspective, this course will demonstrate that morality and ethics is by no means an abstract subject best studied by philosophers. Students will be encouraged to see ethics as a part of their everyday lives, and to see the lives of others as shaped by shared human problems such as how to get along with other people, and how to get along with oneself. This course is divided into four major units. It begins with an issue highly relevant to university students: the responsibility individuals carry for their own success and self-fulfillment in capitalist societies. The second unit considers why moral and cultural differences have been conflated, and how different societies have responded to shared human problems in different ways. The third unit explores the relationship between morality and the creation and maintenance of social relationships. Case studies of small communities in different parts of the world will be especially helpful for understanding morality and ethics from a social perspective, as cooperation can be fragile yet so important in small communities. Topics and readings in the last unit offer resources for enriching and expanding our vocabulary of virtues. Students will be invited to conduct research into the mundane things ordinary people do to take care of one another in daily life."
"(UGED2668 is double-coded with ANTH2730.) This course aims to give students the basic knowledge and training on cultural heritage preservation, including archaeological excavation, report and analysis, and the preservation of ancient architectures and monuments. The course includes the following topics: (1) concepts and international conventions/policies of cultural heritage preservation; (2) archaeological recording and analysis; and (3) preservation of ancient architectures and monuments: intangible and digital heritage standards and procedures."
"(UGED2669 is double-coded with ANTH2351.) Death is both a human universal and a process deeply affected by the cultural context in which it occurs. Dealing with death, both practically and psychologically, is something that all humans must face. This course examines death and death ritual through the question of what is universal and what is culturally variant about how humans face death. It looks at death and death ritual in both modern and pre-modern contexts and analyses it socially, psychologically, politically, and culturally. From the course students will learn how the treatment of death varies cross-culturally; how understandings of death have shifted over human cultural evolution; what aspects of death are universal in human experience; and how death affects contemporary politics, economics, and culture."
"This course aims to discuss the prominent thoughts directing educational practice and their philosophical origins or foundations. Educational thoughts concerning the topics such as the meaning and aims of education, content and practice of teaching and learning will be introduced and examined in relation to various fields of philosophical investigation concerning knowledge and value, humanity and society, etc. Traditional and modern, Chinese and Western perspectives on education will be scrutinized."
"(UGED2700 is double-coded with GPAD2300.)  This course is to expose students to the field of human rights as a cross-disciplinary sub-discipline in law and political science. This course will assist students to better understand the debate concerning human rights both at home and abroad. The course will cover the international law and political issues in this field, the application of human rights in the domestic context and major problems in international human rights practice, including, for example, questions of gender discrimination, humanitarian intervention in domestic conflicts, poverty and human rights, and questions of universalism and cultural relativism."
"Different values and beliefs, opposing clinical objectives, and resource limitations are persistent issues in medical and healthcare settings, from which ethical dilemmas could arise among healthcare practitioners, patients, and their family members, who are unavoidably engaged in the decision-making process in difficult health, life, and death scenarios. These scenarios may include but are not limited to organ donation, resuscitation of a terminally ill loved one, withdrawing or withholding life-sustaining and standard curative treatments for an end-of-life patient, active euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, as well as healthcare rationing. While a well-established legal and health system can provide guidelines for walking through these processes, the values and beliefs of the patients, healthcare workers, and other decision-makers (including family members and guardians) would shape the way decisions are made. Therefore, understanding the factors that may shape or influence one’s values and moral beliefs is crucial for any meaningful discussions to resolve these dilemmas. This course will use a systematic approach to guide students in understanding the moral theories and principles pertinent to the works of bioethics, identifying the morally salient features and arguments of selected clinical, healthcare, and health-related scenarios, discussing and analyzing the main bioethical issues of those scenarios, as well as describing ways to resolve the relevant moral dilemma. Students will be introduced to different simulation exercises and scenarios to realize and reflect on the factors that shape their own decisions as well as moral values and beliefs. The course will utilize lectures, tutorials, case studies, and sharing of hands-on experience to guide students in adopting an all-rounded, holistic, and perspective-based approach to discuss and resolve the bioethical dilemmas related to health, life, and death matters."
"Humans always hope for freedom. But we are finite beings. Most of what happens to us is beyond our control and decision. Is our will free? Is life determined? In what sense can we make a free choice? What can and what should we do in the face of destiny? This course will deal with these significant problems and the tension between freedom and destiny, in order to stimulate students’ reflection on their own lives."
"Environmental issues are most often approached through the STEM disciplines and social sciences. However, the humanities have the potential to help us understand and transform how we view and relate to the natural world. This course explores environmental issues from an interdisciplinary perspective integrating philosophy and the arts.The first part of the course addresses central issues in environmental philosophy and ethics. We will examine (a) the concepts of nature and environment; (b) the relationship between the human being and its environment, between culture and nature; and (c) the Anthropocene, the geological epoch in which human activity is the primary factor shaping environmental change. We then turn to environmental ethics, asking what moral responsibilities we have to non-human living beings and ecosystems. We conclude the first part of the course with a discussion of the aesthetic value of nature. In the second part of the course, we will examine the role of the arts (especially literature, visual art, and film) in shaping our relationship with the natural world and motivating climate action. We will apply concepts from environmental philosophy and humanities to develop a deeper appreciation and critical understanding of environmental artworks, with a focus on work from Hong Kong artists. Throughout the course, experiential learning activities will give students the chance to see how transforming our understanding and relationship with nature can improve our overall well-being.This course bears on several of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We will see how work in the humanities and arts can motivate climate action (SDG#13 Climate Action). By reimagining our relationship with the environment and the connections between nature and culture, we can envision more sustainable ways of life in a heavily urbanized space like Hong Kong (SDG#11 Sustainable Cities and Communities). And by transforming our attitude towards and relationship with nature, we enjoy the mental health benefits of a deepened appreciation of and connection with nature (SDG#3 Good Health and Well-Being)."
"(UGED2891 is double-coded with GDRS2003.)  This course aims at a philosophical discussion on the theories of love in the Chinese and Western culture. Topics include: evaluation of the philosophical approach to the phenomena of love and the Chinese and Western tradition, classical Western theories of love, Christian thought on love, traditional Chinese theories of love, and philosophy of love in modern society."
This course examines the philosophical reflection on travel in both Chinese and Western culture. It will provide students with a good understanding of the multifaceted relationships between travel and human existence from an interdisciplinary perspective. What make us go? How the travel or tourist experiences have been constructed? Topics to be discussed include: different forms of travel throughout history; mobility and the dynamics of space and time; the death of distance and the end of travel; nomad philosophy and the meaning of travel in the post-modern world.
"This course aims at an interdisciplinary study of the problem of death and immortality. The ideas of death and the arguments for and against the possibility of life after death in both Chinese and Western culture will be examined from the religious, psychological, and philosophical perspectives. Classical and modern theories on this topic will be discussed. The purpose of this course is to examine the meaning of life from a theoretical reflection on its apparent opposite—death, thus enhancing students' ability to think critically about life and death."
"The course aims to explore aspects of human life as reflected in philosophy and film. It introduces aesthetic concepts, film languages, and different schools and styles of film-making. It also explores the philosophical implications of films. Through selected films, students will be encouraged to develop critical thinking skills and concern for the meaning of life. Discussion will focus on three categories: (1) films concerning humanities: the nobleness and darkness of human nature, the joy and sadness of love, and the absurdity of life; (2) films concerning virtual reality: the implications of the emulated world in sci-fi films, self-consciousness, and the crisis of false memory; (3) the metaphysical significance in films: the image of death, the origin of holiness and evil, and theism versus atheism."
"The course aims to introduce to students conceptions and misconceptions about sign language and deaf community. Crucially it explores how deaf and hearing people perceive sign language and deafness and how such perceptions from the hearing and deaf communities might lead to ideological conflicts in the preservation of socio-cultural values of the deaf community and its language, in the methodology and technology of speech and language rehabilitation, and in the mode of deaf education. The course will address these conflicting ideologies from the perspectives of linguistics, sociology, cultural studies, psychology, medicine and education."
"This course provides an opportunity for students to reflect on the formation of ""self"" in society and how the society affects our understanding of love, consumption, education, work, and meaning of life. Selected references in sociology, psychology, religion and literature will be introduced to provide a board intellectual perspective to understand the complex relationships between self and society. Students are expected to acquire an ability to analyze and critique on how different social institutions such as education, religion, family, media, work, consumerism, state, etc., affect our attitude and behaviors in some essential issues of life such as mate choice. Following the tradition of critical theory, this course assumes that this reflection is the first step for liberating from ""bad faith"" and living an authentic life. Through reflection on experience that affects them most, students are encouraged to critically examine sustainability issues concerning the well-beings of young people (topic 1, 2, 3 and SDG3), quality of education (topic 4 and SDG4), sustainability in the workplace (topic 5 and SDG8) and inequalities in the local context (topic 3, 4, 5 and SDG10)."
"(UGED2980 is double-coded with ANTH2350.)  In societies across the world, people have different culturally-shaped senses of what their lives mean: people may live for money, love, honour or fame; for family, company, country or religion. This course examines the processes through which meanings of life are formulated and maintained in day-to-day life in societies past and present; it also explores life meaning as a way of comprehending the evolution of human societies. The course uses the concept of ""meanings of life"" as a window into the anthropological understanding of cultural difference and cultural evolution."
"(UGED3143 is double-coded with ENGE3220.) The aim of this course is to familiarize students with the kindred relationships between film and literature as well as their essential mediumistic differences such as film and the novel, film and drama/theatre, film and poetry, etc. Their similar or different uses of time and space, and problems of adaptation will be discussed in some works which have both filmic and literary versions."
"(UGED3205 is double-coded with GDRS3012.)   Institutions such as lineage and family, marriage, religion, medical practices, art, education and politics shape our life patterns as well as social mores. Gender, as one of the building blocks of society and culture, shapes our values and is deeply embedded in our daily lives, and it weaves an intricate ideological fabric that strongly impacts our thoughts, feelings and action.  Through the exploration of selected issues in Chinese culture which are significant and relevant to everyday life, this course introduces to students historical materials which relate to, and contemporary research on, the role of gender in the making of history and culture, and how history and culture work to shape our understanding of gender. As they participate in the learning activities of the course, students will be gradually led to understand Chinese culture from a new perspective. Furthermore, students will have a chance to reflect on long-held values and beliefs which they themselves have acquired as members of this culture, or which they witness in the daily life of the community around them. While helping students to further understand the Chinese culture and history in a new gendered perspective, this course resonates with the Sustanable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by United Nations, including SDG 5 (Gender Equality) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities). Students reflect on their various values and concepts in daily life through this course, and become a global citizen with an open mind."
"(UGED3206 is double-coded with GDRS3011.)  In 21st century post-colonial Hong Kong, the preservation of ‘collective memory’ of this fast-changing city has become an everyday discourse. From award-winning movies, heart-warming testimonies, tabloid stories to Facebook groups and social campaigns, we have been consuming, constructing, and circulating narratives of ‘the past’. This act of remembering and exploring ‘our history’ questions a mainstream Hong Kong story of success demonstrated by economic development and material wealth, and attempts to identify discontinuities, gaps and silenced voices in the dominating narrative. It has also prompted reflections on the relation between narrative and identity — personal, collective, and spatial — in historical inquiry, and in what ways the writing of history has been shaped by disparate ideals, values, web of relations and power. This course will revisit Hong Kong’s history through the exploration of narratives documenting women, a group often made invisible in history writing, as social actors in the fabric of colonial Hong Kong. From elites’ households to textile factories, from rural villages, western-district brothels to mid-levels convents, schools and hospitals, women of different generations have worked as caregivers, breadwinners, pioneers, and educators while contesting the prescribed subordinate status as objects of exploitation in a patriarchal society. Drawing from a wide range of sources, including archival documents, published biographies, autobiographies, memoirs, family histories, school histories, and oral histories, this course will seek to introduce a multi-faceted history of colonial Hong Kong with women as the focus of inquiry. The discussion of women’s narratives will be situated in respective historical contexts linking the personal to social, political and economic changes in Hong Kong under colonial rule. It will also discuss the use of auto/biographies and oral histories as a methodology in historical research investigating the relations between memory, self and identity.The course resonates with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 by directly engaging in critical reflections that help students work towards the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 10 (Reduced Inequalities), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions)."
"(UGED3208 is double-coded with GDRS3004.)  This course reviews basic concepts, theories and research findings of romantic love and intimate relationship. Various aspects of romantic love and intimate relationship will be critically reviewed. Based on research from a wide range of disciplines including gender studies, cultural studies, sociology, psychology, counselling, media studies, among various fields, together with input from literature and popular culture, the course will cover major areas such as the following: how do we understand the notions of “love” and “intimacy” in the different social and personal contexts, what are the different stages in a relationship; the influence of cultural myths and social scripts; interpersonal processes within romantic relationships (such as attraction, social cognition, communication and conflicts, etc.); how social gender role shapes romantic feelings and behaviors; notions of equality and freedom within relationships; power and violence; intimate relationship across life span, etc. Students are encouraged to actively reflect upon their own life experience, to engage in critical discussions of cultural phenomenon through case studies, and learn to untangle the cultural myths, norms, and stereotypes that shapes our private lives and our society in general. Upon the completion of the course, students should demonstrate basic understanding of structure, functions, dynamics, and development of romantic love and other interpersonal relationship. The personal is political. As personal relationships are the most basic social relationships that makes up the larger network of social relationships, it is hope that students could use knowledge from this course as an insight to understand, develop, and improve the quality of their own interpersonal relationship, and would aspire to build a more open and equal society starting from equalitarian and mindful personal relationships."
"(UGED3322 is double-coded with CURE3145.)  This course studies Buddhism and contemporary life in the context of the new development of Buddhism.
