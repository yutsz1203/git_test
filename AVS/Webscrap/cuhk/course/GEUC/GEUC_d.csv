"It has been well established that experiential training is an excellent means of developing leadership, confidence, team spirit and other qualities of character. For many years the development of such qualities has been recognized as being of high importance by the senior management of the academic, non-government and commercial organizations. Leadership is best learned by doing. This course will explore and examine leadership theory and practice through experiential learning in the outdoor and a different setting rather than studying mainly in a classroom. It provides students with a structured, supervised programme of participation in the practice of leadership and teambuilding. The goal of this course is to help students acquire practical skills and judgment to develop their leadership qualities.

"The course aims to develop “T-shaped” characters who can develop the depth of expertise in a single field (one’s major as represented by the vertical bar of the T) while acquiring the ability to communicate and collaborate with others from different disciplines (the horizontal bar of the T) to address challenges. The ability to connect horizontally is “design thinking”. Individuals equipped with the ability to think as a designer will be able to innovate, tackle complex problems and manage changes in real life situations. With “design thinking” or by “thinking as a designer”, students can begin to understand how our world has come to its current form through intended and unintended design. Knowing that the only thing that is not designed, is nature, humans need to learn where to draw the line. By acquiring a designer’s mindset in looking at the world, each person can do one’s part to be a responsible and conscious prosumer of design. This includes utilizing eco-friendly artifacts and designing one’s learning, career and life experience on this planet in a responsible way."
