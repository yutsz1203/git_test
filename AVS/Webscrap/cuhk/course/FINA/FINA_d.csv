"Traditional finance seeks to understand financial markets assuming that investors are “rational.” Rationality means that investors can access to and have the ability to process information correctly and that competition between investors ensures that securities are correctly priced to reflect all available information. That is, the market is efficient. However, recent studies suggest that markets are not efficient and that investors are not fully rational. For example, particular trading strategies based on past information such as past returns and accounting information are able to outperform the markets. In addition, studies find that investors are committed to certain heuristic-based biases and frame dependent such as overconfidence, optimism, self-attribution, illusion of control, loss aversion, representativeness heuristic, anchoring, availability, ambiguity aversion, hindsight, flaming, etc. Behavioral biases combined with limits to arbitrage may result in securities not to be correctly priced.This course will help students understand how individuals’ attitudes and behaviors affect their financial decisions and financial markets.

"This course provides an overview of the basic tools in machine learning, with emphases on applications in finance. Machine learning plays an important role in FinTech.

Dealing with such large datasets require tools to manipulate them, and we will introduce the use of Python and detailed instructions on how to perform analysis on large datasets. Once students become comfortable with the use of Python and manipulation of large sets, we will introduce students to tools in machine learning, which play an important role in our financial market, from approving loans, managing portfolios, to assessing risks. Advances in machine learning technology have enabled financial institutions to explore the applications of artificial intelligence in areas like customer service, personal finance, wealth management, and risk management."

"Traditional finance seeks to understand financial markets assuming that investors are ""rational"". Rationality means that investors can access to and have the ability to process information correctly and that competition between investors ensures that securities are correctly priced to reflect all available information. That is, the market is efficient. However, recent studies suggest that markets are not efficient and that investors are not fully rational. For example, particular trading strategies based on past information such as past returns and accounting information are able to outperform the markets. In addition, studies find that investors are committed to certain heuristic-based biases and frame dependent such as overconfidence, optimism, self-attribution, illusion of control, loss aversion, representativeness heuristic, anchoring, availability, ambiguity aversion, hindsight, flaming, etc. Behavioral biases combined with limits to arbitrage may result in securities not to be correctly priced.This course will help students understand how individuals’ attitudes and behaviors affect their financial decisions and financial markets.
