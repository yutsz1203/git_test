The applications of immunology to modern medicine and biotechnology, including vaccination, monoclonal antibody production and antibody engineering will also be covered. Students are advised to take BCHE2030 or equivalent before taking this course."
"This course is to prepare our students with the necessary knowledge and skills for career development and to meet the future demands in the biomedical industries. Core knowledge such as basic concepts and skills of laboratory management, safety and quality assurance in biochemical laboratories will be introduced. Special topics in biochemical testing, manufacturing process, good laboratory practice, laboratory accreditation, and validation of experimental protocols and methods will also be discussed. Part of the class will be taught with MSc students under different course code and assessment scheme."
"This course aims at introducing various biochemical principles and techniques for forensic analysis to the students. Students will learn how to observe, collect, analyze and evaluate evidence found at crime scenes.
