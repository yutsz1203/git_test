"(UGED1796 is double-coded with EPIN1010.) This course is an introduction to the mindset and values of an entrepreneur. The primary objective is to make students appreciate and adapt to change in the world of entrepreneurship. Whether a student takes the entrepreneurial path or chooses to become a manager in the corporate world upon graduation, the entrepreneurial spirit as inspired by the journey of a successful entrepreneur will help produce out-of-the-box ideas and the ability to cope with challenges in the business world.In this course, prominent figures and seasoned entrepreneurs will be invited to share their real stories and experiences regarding creativity, innovation, problem-solving and entrepreneurship in different situations. As “fail early fail fast” has become the unofficial mantra in the Silicon, guest speakers are encouraged to give an honest account of their devastating failures and reveal how they survive, adapt, and achieve eventual success."
"The course aims to develop ""T-shaped"" characters who can develop the depth of expertise in a single field (one's major as represented by the vertical bar of the T shape) while acquiring the ability to communicate and collaborate with others from different disciplines (the horizontal bar of the T) to address challenges. The ability to connect horizontally is ""Design Thinking"", which is the bridge between creativity and innovation, combining divergent and convergent modes of problem discovery and problem solving to integrate user-experience, technology tools, and business models to create values.By acquiring a designer's perspective in looking at the world, students can learn to appreciate what it means to ""think out of a box"" --- the thinking style that transcends traditional management control and disciplinary mindset. They can create more alternatives beyond one’s own disciple to foster more systemic and holistic implementation. This course is for students who not only know how to solve problems but know what problems to solve."
"Creativity and Innovation is something that is crucial for entrepreneurs, but are often perceived as mysterious and attainable only by a few. The main purpose of this course is for you to have a breath of understanding in the field of creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship using psychological principles. To achieve this goal, the course will use evidence based research in psychological sciences to help student understand what creativity is at an individual, team and global level, and how to use psychological tools to enhance their own creativity. Students will also understand how creativity is applied in innovation and entrepreneur settings. Through classroom learning, case analysis, team work and field work, students will have a good understanding on the foundations of the above topics, and be able to apply psychological tools to understand current issues such as social innovation, social entrepreneurship, and everyday problems."
"The course aims to prepare students with skills essential for “pursuing opportunity without regard to resources currently at hand.” It will develop in students several key entrepreneurial skills rather than covering comprehensive topics as in an introductory course. Since pursuing an entrepreneurial endeavour has to overcome obstacles and deal with challenges in novel and uncertain situations, we must transform and give new emphasis to skills commonly used in other problem-solving situations. Indeed, a number of new processes and accompanying languages have to be invented for entrepreneurial practices. Additionally, because changes happen fast, the skill sets essential for entrepreneurial success must be matched with the latest technological and societal development, and to the needs of different student cohorts. By the end of the course, students should become more effective and confident in implementing their entrepreneurial plan or innovation project."
"A short-term internship allows students to transfer their classroom learning to workplace activities and provides them with valuable exposure to different industry sectors and startup companies. At a minimum, students are required to complete 6 weeks of internship experience to fulfill the course requirement. The educational objectives can be achieved through industry activities that are either operational based and/or project based. All internship experiences must be approved by the EPIN Minor Program and the course coordinator."
"A business model is a logical and internally consistent representation of the design and operations of a business, capturing the essence of how it will be focused and demonstrating how an interrelated set of decision variables will be addressed to create, deliver and capture value. By one definition, a business model consists of four interlocking elements: • The customer value proposition (how does the firm create value for a customer) • The profit formula (how does the firm capture value for itself while providing value to the customer) • The key resources required to deliver the value proposition to the targeted customer • The key processes that allow a firm to deliver value in a repeatable and scalable manner. Business model innovation is focused on the design and development of new and unique business models that, by definition, challenge accepted conventions in a given industry about how to create and deliver customer value while making sustainable profits for the entrepreneur and his investors. This course will explore the range and diversity of existing perspectives about business models and the tools of analysis essential to their understanding. We will learn to analyze and evaluate existing business models and pursue a logical and internally consistent approach to the choice and/or development of an appropriate business model for a new enterprise. The application of the course frameworks, tools and techniques will be illustrated with case studies and evaluated in a semester project involving the development of an innovative business model for an entrepreneurial venture."
"This course inculcates multi-disciplinary problem-solving ability and experiences through intensive exchange and project work in a few weekdays. It involves teaching teams and students from different disciplines targeting at problems or challenges whose solutions required cross-fertilization of knowledge and innovative ideas. Students will participate in hands-on learning to come up with innovative solutions for challenges in a specific domain, problem, or industry."
Advances in technology and communication devices will change how medicine is being practices. We will no longer beholden to an impersonal and paternalistic system in which hospitals and doctors dictate decisions for patients. Medicine has been digitized; it will be democratized together with a change in social roles and cost structures. This course aims to inculcate multi-disciplinary problem-solving ability and experiences through intensive exchange and project work in a few weekdays. Students will participate in hands-on learning to come up with innovative solutions for delegating choices and providing affordable solutions to patients and promoting inclusive health care.
"Advances in technology and entrepreneurship require continual adaptation and pivot at strategic juncture. The environment is uncertain and changes all the time; competitors emerge over time unexpectedly; learning from customers leads to new ideas. This course aims to inculcate multi-disciplinary problem-solving ability and experiences through intensive exchange and project work in a few weekdays. Students will participate in hands-on learning to find and develop solutions for startup, R&D, or corporate venturing teams to pivot at their critical juncture."
"The Entrepreneurship Practicum course is an interactive and hands-on experience for students who want to participate in the entrepreneurial start-up business process. It is designed for students enrolled in the EPIN Minor Programme, although those with adequate background will also be allowed. Students will participate in an internship or be a part-time employee with a start-up. Through the active participation and field work, students should acquire professional knowledge and practical experience in a new venture."
"Startups and Entrepreneurs are often required to communicate their innovative ideas, such as new products and services, through multi-media. Crowdfunding websites such as Kickstarter.com have numerous examples of effective video communications that lead to successful product launches and funding goal completion. Photography and videography have also become a language to engage the new generations on social media such as YouTube and Instagram. This course is designed for innovators who want to translate their ideas into compelling audio and video works. Through pre-production, filming, to post-production, students will learn the visual-audio language, basic skills and techniques of filmmaking, including production by using Adobe Premiere and After Effect, etc. It consists of lectures, readings, screenings and consultations, hands-on visual projects and mini- workshops; it helps students to explore and develop their conceptual and aesthetic styles."
A short-term internship allows students to transfer their classroom learning to workplace activities and provides them with valuable exposure to different industry sectors and startup companies. Students are required to complete 12 to 24 weeks of internship experience to fulfill the course requirement. The educational objectives can be achieved through industry activities that are either operational based and/or project based. All internship experiences must be approved by the EPIN Minor Program and the course coordinator.
"The EPIN Project provides an opportunity for students to integrate their knowledge and experience gained in formal coursework and co-curricular activities, and put them into practice by developing an innovative idea and implementation plan. Students in groups of no more than 6 students comprising of different disciplines and background will pursue independent projects in technological innovation, social innovation, or other kinds of entrepreneurial endeavors. With the guidance of a faculty mentor and external experts of related fields, each group will deliver an innovative idea that is both feasible and impactful to the society and/or the market.Students are encouraged to pursue a project in which they have some competence based on their academic training or practical experience. Within a multidisciplinary group, members will complement each other with their respective strengths and expertise. They are also strongly recommended to pursue an idea initiated in other courses and/or occasions such as competitions and internship. It is ideal that an idea is conceived, developed and eventually realized throughout the EPIN journey. The EPIN Project offers an opportunity to push an idea to a mature stage and be ready for implementation. Outstanding performers in entrepreneurship and innovation competitions, for examples, will be invited to participate in this credit-bearing course."
"Entrepreneurial and innovative endeavors usually involve cutting-edge technologies and ground-breaking ideas, which help solve evolving problems in a highly volatile and uncertain environment. The purpose of the Special Topic course is to raise awareness of emerging trends and solutions in different areas, and equip students with knowledge in the field yet to be covered by existing courses."
"A short-term internship allows students to transfer their classroom learning to workplace activities and provides them with valuable exposure to different industry sectors and startup companies. At a minimum, students are required to complete 24 weeks of internship experience to fulfill the course requirement.
