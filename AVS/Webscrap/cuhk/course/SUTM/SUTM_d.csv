"The course introduces the scope, nature and trends of tourism as well as the concept of sustainability and its application to the strategic planning for tourism. Tourism as a contemporary leisure experience is examined along with economic, political and social ramifications and implications for the future. Selected tourism resources and impacts of the activity on the host countries, both developed and developing, and environments will be discussed, followed by an examination of the principles of good practice in tourism.

"This course analyses the nature and importance of cultural heritage as capital for tourism. Introductory lectures identify various types of heritage (tangible and intangible) and provide an understanding of the concept, scope and evolution of cultural-heritage tourism. Issues of cultural and artistic authenticity, identity production and marketing, and commodification of both tourists and the toured will further be examined. Case studies from Hong Kong and other parts of the world will be studied to identify specific socio-economic and cultural costs and benefits associated with this kind of tourism. The course will also explore approaches and policies of cultural heritage management and conservation to enable sustainable tourism development, with particular emphasis on the cases of Hong Kong and the Pearl River Delta."
"This course is intended to expose students to the understanding of basic concepts, trends, philosophy and challenges of ecotourism. It will investigate and seek to understand policy implications of ecotourism development. While ecotourism is the fastest growing sector of the world's tourism industry, it is still not well understood. Where ecotourism is being conceived and practiced, there is often a dearth of knowledge in ecotourism policy aspects. The course will draw on examples of various tourism policy initiatives with approaches concerning the environment, local community, tourists, businesses and those affected by this type of tourism."
"Nature-based tourism definitely is one of the most popular tourism forms in the world. It refers to a number of tourist activities associated with the natural environment. In this course, some of the concepts and related issues, such as distinctions between nature-based tourism and other forms of tourism, benefits and challenges of nature-based tourism, management of natural and ecological resources, park design and management, interpretation, sustainability, participation of local communities and nature based tourism products, will be explored. In order to enhance the learning experience, an interactive teaching mode will be adopted in the lectures so that the instructors can guide students to analyze the cases and issues through queries and answers. Furthermore, field trips will also be organized in which students can articulate what they learn from the class teaching. This course attempts to provide students with a comprehensive introduction to nature-based tourism, with the following specific objectives: - To examine the key concepts, theories and techniques in the management of natural and ecological resources;  - To analyze the importance of natural and ecological resources for development of nature based tourism; and - To help students develop critical thinking on the planning and management of natural environment and nature based tourism."
"The course will cover the aspects of resource impacts of visitor activities to sites, seek to understand resource management practices at destinations and study and propose visitor management and education programs relevant to sustainable tourism. To fully understand global issues of protected areas, comparative issues on major planning and management aspects; and undertake impact assessment and monitoring."
"This course is designed to provide students the opportunity to apply basic knowledge learnt in the real world. It will help students develop environmentally friendly outdoor skills by developing concepts and techniques of communication and interpretation. The course will seek to equip students with skills to plan, develop and manage ecotourism sites and enterprises. A series of workshops, seminars and field trips and fieldwork will compliment the lectures."
"Tourism in cities and their urban areas is an important and complicated phenomenon. Various forms of tourist activities contribute to the operations, structures and interactions within and between cities, as well as the stakeholders therein. This course is designed to allow students to investigate, study and understand the context of urban tourism. With increasing challenges caused by globalization, urbanization, tourist arrival, and the demand of additional infrastructure and resources, tourism will have to assume a new dimension in the urban context.This course attempts to explain the inter-relationships between tourism and urban environment by identifying the nature of the tourism industry in the urban areas. The course examines topical issues related to the process of development of urban tourism, its varied forms of activities, and the relevant contemporary issues relating to the management and marketing of urban destinations. By completing the course, students will be able to understand, apply and challenge concepts, theories and knowledge in urban tourism. Students will also be able to describe and assess the importance of geographical characteristics in tourism decision-making processes in the urban area."
"The importance of field studies for tourism students is immeasurable. It forms a major complimentary aspect of the programme and is designed to give the students an opportunity to understand the real-world situation. The aim of the course is to enable students to take part in field studies away from Hong Kong where they will get involved a “local” field project that gives a stimulating, realistic and practical experience that will add value to the educational experience. The field studies programme will be undertaken in a local environment that will allow the students to take active part, identify and put theories into practice by collecting data, analyzing and interpreting the information for strategic planning and location analysis of the tourism industry.While this will provide the opportunity for individual development of the students, it will also provide an opportunity for students to work as a team in project management and problem-solving. Students are required to participate in all activities throughout the field studies, do presentations and submit reports on completion."
Students are required to carry out independent studies of selected topics in sustainable tourism under staff supervision. Evaluation will be based on project presentations and written reports.
