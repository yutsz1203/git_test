"(UGED1602 is double-coded with SOWK1130.) Death is not special. It happens every day and everywhere. It is also an inevitable part of life. Yet, death is very important for us especially when we are confronted by the death and dying of our loved ones. Surprisingly, we have done little to prepare ourselves to get familiar with the topic of bereavement. Very often we learn it only from the most painful and heartbreaking moments in life—after the death of loved ones.
