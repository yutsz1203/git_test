Utilizing innovative teaching methods to enable students to critically understand the physical as well as cultural character of the city, and so the nation at large, a multidisciplinary approach is fostered so as to encourage learners to recognize and explain factors that have influenced Philippines civilization as it progressed from the “traditional” to the “modern”. Encouraging learners too to identify connections between the country and places elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, ultimately the course places the evolution of life in the Philippine Archipelago within the greater Asia-Pacific region. Accordingly, the curriculum is cut into two distinct sections: The Philippines pre-1898; and, the Philippines post-1898.

"The module intends to provide a survey of the origins and transformations of industrial society over the last two centuries or so, a period of time within which industrial nation states have reached new heights of power and acquired the dominant share of the world’s wealth – a wealth once dominated by Westerners but increasingly challenged in recent years by the rise of, for example, South East Asian nations. This comparative studies programme shall allow students to obtain a critical understanding of the nature of industrial society through fostering a multidisciplinary approach to industrialisation and many of the changes in society it helped to establish. The course will give students the opportunity to consider the ideas and the conditions in Europe and elsewhere that produced industrial change, capitalism and democracy – processes that the West considered then and still considers today as desirable for itself and other parts of the world. The curriculum gives particular focus to pre-industrial Europe and its economy, industrial Britain, urbanisation and its effects upon social classes, public health, housing and ways of living. The course is designed to build skills such as thinking critically, well-constructed writing and the clear presenting of oral arguments. In so doing students will be expected to critically engage with a range of academic disciplines such as History (social and economic, cultural and urban), Social Studies, Economics and Geography, so as to answer questions such as:• In what ways did industrialisation fundamentally change societies?• What factors accounted for the beginning of the Industrial Revolution?• How did patterns of urbanisation change as a consequence of industrial growth?• How did social class relations shift due to industrial progress?• How did industrial changes affect the role of women or children in the work place?• What demographic changes have occurred since industrialisation began?• Were the First and Second Industrial Revolutions the same or were they different?• How did rural developments affect the rise of industry in Europe’s past?• What is the relationship between cities and the countryside both before and after the onset of industrial growth?• What dangers arise from industrial and urban transition? Are these dangers universal?"
"This course aims at two goals: to inform the students about the major aspects of the civilization of ancient Egypt, such as history, art, religion, literature, society, and to allow students to form their own idea of how our modern knowledge of ancient Egypt was formed. Thus whenever a subject is offered, students will be given the evidence, so that knowledge about the subject should be based on a conscious reflection upon available evidence and logical reasoning. In addition to knowledge of ancient Egyptian civilization, students will also learn how the study of humanity can be conducted from a historical perspective."
"The ancient Mediterranean world (c. 800 BCE-250 CE) is often seen as the fountainhead of “Western” culture, but what was it really like? This course will have two aims: to understand the core contributions (philosophical, political, literary, etc.) of the ancient Mediterranean world to later periods of “Western” history, and to understand its relationship to the rest of the world (Han China, India, ancient Near East, etc.). To do so, we will focus on a series of “moments” (and the related sources), which either had a particular influence on later periods or display the interconnectedness of the ancient world."
"The 'Middle East' is a geographical concept developed by officials in the British Empire in the 19th century to describe the lands between Europe and their distant colonies in India and East Asia. In the 21st century, we often associate the Middle East with the Muslim religion and Arab culture, but it is a vast region spanning from Morocco to India and home to countless peoples and faiths. It is the birthplace not just of Islam but also of Christianity, Judaism, and other religions, while its peoples speak not just Arabic but also Farsi, Turkish, French, and more. At its extremities, the Middle East connects China, Europe, and Africa.This course provides a broad survey of Middle Eastern history from the last days of the ancient Roman and Persian Empires in the 6th century to the emergence of modern Middle Eastern nationalisms in the 19th. It looks at the most important themes of change and continuity in the region, examining the important historical dynamics that have made the Middle East what it is today. The course also situates its subject matter in the wider context of world history, exploring how the Middle East has affected, and been affected by, events in Europe, Africa, Asia, and even the Americas."
"The early modern period (c. 1400-1800 CE) was highly formative for modern (i.e industrial and post-industrial) “Western” societies, featuring the beginnings of modern European politics, culture, religion, science, colonialism, etc. This course will have two aims: to understand the continuities and innovations during the early modern period of “Western” history, and to understand its relationship to the rest of the world (Ming-Qing China, India, the Americas, Africa, etc.). This course will also feature a visit to the CUHK Rare Book Collection to examine early modern printed books."

"This course is an intellectual inquiry into woman’s lives in social, political, and cultural contexts from the period of late 19th century to the present. We will employ a hybrid chronological and thematic approach to explore the personal experience of women as well as the contexts of society and politics in different times that women lived in. We will discuss the agency of women not merely as passive observers but at times as contributors to shape history. We will read scholarly materials and examine primary sources of memoirs, autobiographies, biographies, and oral history accounts. We will focus not only on those who are known in history, but also on ordinary individuals whose lives were affected, changed, destroyed, interrupted, empowered, and inspired by the forces of history. We will examine both the powerful and the powerless, and the power of the powerless to affect their own destiny. The course will employ a flipped classroom approach with an aim to cultivate community, collaboration, and creativity. Students are also encouraged to contribute to the documentation of women in social and political condition at different periods of history."

"This course examines the history of the relationship between Taiwan and mainland China since the end of World War II, when Taiwan ceased to be a Japanese colony. The victory of the Communists in China's civil war in 1949 and the relocation of the Kuomintang Government to Taipei sparked off the dispute over Taiwan's status, which endures to the present day. Now President Chen Shui-bian wants to redefine Taiwan's status as a sovereign, independent country whose name is the Republic of China, while Beijing defines Taiwan as part of China. This course will examine the stand taken on Taiwan by key international actors, in particular the United States, but including Japan and the European Union. It will look at the Taiwan Straits military crises of the 1950s and the role of the United States, the initial strong international support for the KMT government as the sole legal government of all China until the tide turned in 1971, with Beijing replacing Taipei in the United Nations. It will also examine various international documents that have a bearing on the international status of Taiwan as well as statements issued by the government in Taiwan and leading political parties there as well as white papers on Taiwan issued by the People's Republic of China."
"This course attempts to understand Modern Chinese local societies’ social structure, principles of organization, ethnic relations and process of social change through an analysis and interpretation of festivals and popular religion. The course is divided into two parts: the first part, from a macro perspective, discusses the “position” of festivals and popular religion in the Chinese Imperial State and local society. We will try to discuss (1) how did the Ming Qing Government sanction and control local ritual activities? (2) How did different social groups depict festivals and popular religion in different periods of time? And (3) How did local society utilize the State language to enhance, adjust, reconstruct and forget local traditions? The second part, through case studies, will investigate local social activities’ organizational method and its changes in order to understand the interactive relationship between tradition and modernization. It also attempts to explore the relationship between historical narration and interpretation from analyses of these case studies."
The course presents the history of the Republic of China from 1912 to 1949 based on archival materials and recent studies published both in China and in the outside world. This course first reviews the current status and development of the field and then introduces some important themes and issues for analysis and discussion.
"(Not for students who have taken HIST5554.) The course introduces different institutions in the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), with an emphasis on the impact of these institutions on the society."
"Archives are the most important information on historical research. However, archives were mainly used in the studying of political history in the past. In the twentieth century, historians have extensively used archival records in social and cultural history and gotten fruitful results. This course begins with the introduction of the research in this area. It also introduces the archives of the British colonial governance in Hong Kong and discusses how to use the archives in the research of Hong Kong History. Since the nineteenth century, Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao have developed a close connection in terms of politics, economy, society and culture; therefore, this course not only focuses on the archives in Hong Kong, but also introduces the collections of archives in Guangdong and Macao."
"Land administration is the key to understand a local society. The land law in Hong Kong is consisted of two parts: (i) the application of common law on Hong Kong island and Kowloon peninsula; and (ii) the use of the Great Qing Code in the New Territories (the broad sense of the New Territories including New Kowloon). However, after the Hong Kong government has implemented the “Small House Policy” since 1972, the so-called “New Territories” does include New Kowloon. This course introduces land administration of Hong Kong (Hong Kong island, Kowloon peninsula, New Territories) from the Qing dynasty up to the present time, and how the land administration affects the livelihood of common people. With regard to basic references, the course uses Hong Kong colonial files as well as the Great Qing Code, but supplemented them with lawsuit judgments and scholarly studies."
"This course is designed to explore the concept, the image and the livelihood of the “common people” from the last decades of the Qing dynasty to the 1940s. This era saw great changes of social and political theory: a ritual life that had reached from emperor into villages came to be articulated in relation to a central government and its cities. The rural population ceased to be central to ritual life and came to be marginalized. Orthodox values came to be looked upon as superstition. Meanwhile, a social ethos came to represent the fashion of a new age, and city life was looked upon as a symbol of progress. This transition from old to new repositioned the individual, family, nation, and even language and gender. This transition has continued to the present day, making us as much its creator as well as its product. This course seeks to raise questions about the society which we take for granted and in which we are now placed has evolved from the late Qing."
"For a long time, historians and anthropologists have recognized that, despite its unity, Chinese society embodies regional social and cultural variations. To understand how Chinese society became a unity, it is necessary to trace the processes by which multiple rituals and customs converged so that they integrated with dynastic traditions. Those processes included the expansion of the imperial state from the Song dynasty to the Republic as well as the reactions of local societies to it. By combining field work and documentary analysis, this course sensitizes students to a history from below in which indigenous communities utilizes state rituals to express their own concerns and identities."
"This module provides an introductory survey of the history of urban development from the ancient period to the end of the twentieth century. It focuses on the forces that have led to the development of cities in the past, and achieves this through the lens of a multi-disciplinary perspective and the utilisation of various methodologies. Such a standpoint is adopted in order to allow for the exploration of the impacts of matters like politics, economics, culture and identity, art and architecture, intellectual thought, law, transportation, and military technology upon urban society at different times in history, and to recognise how they influenced the design and shape of the built environment, and so city living. Central to the programme is the use of comparative analyses which assist in identifying and contrasting patterns of urban change. As such differences in urban design that became evident in the past will be made clear. Furthermore such an approach helps illuminate and clarify the imprint upon urban space and the urban mind of agents affecting the urban development process, including visions and concepts (built and unbuilt) that have swayed social development. Importantly too in utilising this analytical perspective students are granted opportunities to test hypotheses under the guidance of their teacher about the causes and effects of urban transition, in so doing helping explicitly comprehend the narrative of historical urban development in both factual and conceptual terms."
"This course studies the formation and transformation of late imperial Chinese diplomatic system. It examines how China established and maintained the tributary system, or the so-called Pax Sinica in East Asia from the 14th to the 19th century. It analyzes the complex process, starting in mid-19th century, in which China gradually accepted a new international order based on the assumption of nation-state and governed by Western international law."
"This course examines the interactive relations between the Chinese overseas and their hometowns from the 19th century. It attempts to investigate the factors that facilitate overseas migration, the changing perceptions of the Chinese overseas on their hometowns, their contributions towards the promotion or restriction of local modernization and the emigrant communities’ “overseas connections” as cultural capital in the shaping of local politics as well as social and economic lives. This course is divided into two parts. The first part, from a macro perspective, discusses the history of the Chinese overseas migration through an analysis of the business and migration environment and the social and economic foundations of the South China communities from the Ming Qing to the Republican period. The second part, from a micro perspective, examines selected emigrants communities, their social and cultural changes in relation to their overseas connections."
