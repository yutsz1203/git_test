This course introduces students to various dimensions of China’s cultural past. Topics and issues will be determined from year to year by the teacher(s) delivering the course.
"This introductory course examines basic institutions in traditional Chinese society and their modern transformations. It covers topics of Chinese kinship, lineage, family and marriage, popular religion and rituals, state power and its political control, and rural and urban political economies. The lectures draw particular attention to constant modernizing efforts in the past century, especially the socialist revolution and post-Mao reforms, and their bearings upon Chinese society and culture. The readings, drawn from various disciplines – anthropology, history, literature, sociology and political science, to demonstrate the necessity of a multi-disciplinary approach to the study of Chinese culture and society in general."
"The rapid transformation that China is experiencing today cannot be understood without considering the wider context of change in modern Chinese history. How have the Chinese searched for modernity in the recent past? How have changes been experienced by the Chinese people? In this course we shall explore the political, social, and cultural revolutions that have shaped Chinese history since late imperial times. The emphasis of this course will be on analysis of primary sources in translation and discussion of these texts within the context of the historical narrative."
"This course introduces major political institutions and problems of governance in contemporary China to students. Departing from the early years of reform and their culmination in the crisis of 1989, the class investigates the Chinese leadership’s agenda of safeguarding one-party rule through reforms and adjustments in various domains. In order to gain a better understanding of China’s path of political development, particular attention will be paid to the varying degrees of success and the often unintended consequences of these efforts."
"This course offers an overview of the Chinese economy. Since the policies of reform and opening up were initiated in 1978, China has been transformed from a command economy to a market-oriented system and achieved over three decades of rapid growth. This course will address both the historical processes of institutional reform and major economic issues in contemporary China. It aims to provide a roadmap for the students to have a critical view of China’s growth model and obtain an informed perspective on the challenges that the Chinese economy faces now."
"This course focuses on the intriguing relationship between language and culture from a linguistic perspective. Various cultural factors affecting communication will be identified, with specific reference to standard Chinese and the major dialects in China. Examples in real life settings will be given to illustrate the importance of the pragmatic framework in effective interpersonal communication and in proper understanding of Chinese cultures and society as reflected by language."
"This course examines China’s global connections in history as well as at present in a historical anthropological approach. While the whole world is fixated on contemporary China’s global presence with its economic prowess, this course highlights China’s multifaceted yet often unexplored engagement with the rest of the world over the past millennium. It surveys the economic, technological, political, and sociocultural aspects of engagements through trade, diplomacy, war, migration, studying abroad, reading, and imagination."
"This course offers an introductory exploration of the cultural, economic, social, and political dimensions of contemporary China. We will discuss everyday Chinese society and culture, China’s recent formative history, the phenomenon of China’s economic “rise,” and the resulting costs, challenges, and trajectories of its ongoing transformation."
"From Beijing to Hong Kong, Shanghai to Taipei and beyond, this course explores the multiple, effervescent realms of popular culture in China and Chinese communities around the world today. Through reading, talking and writing about and also viewing, listening to and taking part in aspects of Chinese popular culture, students will investigate its production, mass attraction, commercial and social-political presence, and significance to Chinese people and societies and global mass culture. Topics to be presented and analysed will include popular print and online fiction, popular print magazines, animated fiction, animation, popular films, popular music, popular commercial and non-commercial art, television shows, video games, online games and entertainments, popular live culture entertainment, street fashion, body culture, and mass cultural trends."
"This course is a survey of modern Chinese literature in translation. Starting with an examination of definitions of literary modernity itself, the category of Chinese literature and literary trends in late imperial times, the course will discuss new genres, styles and themes of fiction, poetry and non-fiction in the Republican era, the emergence of distinctive Taiwan, Hong Kong, and diasporic sinophone literature, socialist and post-socialist literature, and trends in Chinese literature within the context of globalization at the end of the twentieth century.

Topics will include the “traditional” institutions in the Han Chinese family system and their modern transformations during the Maoist era, the family model among “ethnic minorities,” and contemporary social challenges facing Chinese families (such as family planning, property, and “left-over women”)."
"This course investigates the profound social, cultural and political transformations of war and revolution in China between the 1930s and 1950s. This period of China’s protracted war with Japan, civil war between Nationalists and Communists, and engagement in the Korean War amid the initial triumph of Mao Zedong’s Communist revolution was critical to the formation of the modern Chinese state and society. Through analysis of a wide range of readings in secondary and primary sources to be discussed and presented in class and in short papers, students will explore beyond the received narratives of political causes and military outcomes and in to the multiple ways in which war and revolution were manifested, experienced and remembered. The course will invite reflection on the complexities of social-cultural and political processes of change through war and revolution, as well as, more broadly, on the meanings and functions of violent mass conflicts for modern states and peoples."
"Twenty-first century capitalism has been marked by an increasing international economic interdependence. Modern multinational firms from the high-income countries have spread their businesses across the world just as the Chinese economy has undergone dramatic transformations. This course examines the rise of modern multinational companies, the revolutionary changes in the structure of global business systems since the 1970s, and China’s enterprise reforms in a global context. It will involve theoretical and macro-level analysis with detailed empirical analysis, as well as considerable examination of in-depth case studies from large Chinese firms."
Comparison is a persistent feature of human thinking and political debate. But under what conditions is this strategy useful and when do we compare apples with oranges? This course will introduce students to the logic of comparative analysis and investigate comparative research on contemporary Chinese politics. It aims to help students with placing the country into the global map of political development and heighten their awareness of some unique features of politics in China.
"Almost forty years after the death of Mao, China is still coming to grips with what historians now call the Mao era, from the founding of the People’s Republic in 1949 to his death in 1976. The Mao era has had a profound impact on China’s politics, economy, society, and culture; it is still being felt today. Examining both primary sources and recent scholarship on the Mao years, this course studies the waves of political movements and how they affected the lives of the Chinese people."
"This course studies the history and development of the city of Shanghai, from provincial backwater to international metropolis. As a point of economic, political, and social contact between China and the world, Shanghai has a primary place in both the Chinese and the foreign imagination. In this role, Shanghai has been a model of and for Chinese modernity, though this model has been alternatively championed, critiqued, and questioned. In this course, students will not only study Shanghai’s history and contemporary place in China, they will also consider how historical and contemporary actors have portrayed Shanghai as a model for modernity."
"Over the last three decades the Chinese media underwent a dramatic and ongoing transformation. How has this change affected Chinese politics? This course examines how politics constrain the media and how the media, in turn, shape the political process. It targets rather advanced undergraduate students that possess some background knowledge on contemporary Chinese politics, society, or communication.The course will begin with a brief introduction to the history of the media in China under Communist Party rule. It will then trace the process of commercialization and internet development, and explore how these structural changes gave rise to resolute investigative journalism and flourishing online activism, as well as adaptive reconfigurations of state propaganda and censorship. This is followed by detailed investigations of media effects on popular protest, political attitudes, policy making, nationalism, and diplomacy. The class concludes with a discussion of the links between media transformation and political change."
The field trip will take place either in mainland China or Taiwan. Students will be guided to learn and experience firsthand Chinese culture and society.
"This course offers students an opportunity to conduct individual fieldwork research in China under the guidance of a faculty instructor. Projects will be designed by the student in consultation with the faculty instructor and will be assessed by various means, including a detailed final fieldwork report or research paper."
"This internship course will make it possible for CCS majors to “learn through doing” and “learn through social experience” in a faculty-guided and assessed internship with an organization, institution, company or enterprise in which lessons can be learned about how to make the language, cultural, social and economics-based knowledge and analytical, critical thinking and presentation expression skills learned in China studies relevant to the wide range of “real world” fields outside of the university. In keeping with the CCS educational approach, this course encourages majors to take advantage of learning “on-site” in such an internship based in Hong Kong, mainland China or Taiwan, with the course registered during the regular academic terms or in the summer school terms. Students will be expected to provide regular progress reports to their faculty adviser through a diary or online blog or video presentation, and will submit a final report assessing the organization, its engagement with Chinese society, economy, culture, and the lessons learned for practically applying area studies knowledge and skills to this field. A final oral presentation will also be given and assessed before faculty and student peers at an annual presentation of internships."
This course familiarizes advanced undergraduate students with the fundamentals of empirical research methods and design in the social sciences. The course will be structured into two parts. Part one reviews fundamental concepts of social science research and introduces the major methodological approaches in the social sciences. In the second part the instructor will guide students in designing their own research proposals with a specific focus on specifying research questions and selecting appropriate methods. At the end of the course students should have acquired a solid understanding of the logic of social enquiry and developed a feasible empirical research proposal in the field of social scientific China Studies.
"This course will provide a foundation for students to produce advanced China-focused research projects. Lectures will discuss the many variables involved in the research process, including formulating research questions, familiarity with the language of research, research ethics, methodology, among others. Additionally, assignments and discussions will begin to heighten student awareness of how their research interests and production can make meaningful contributions to the field of Chinese Studies."
"This course provides a survey of field research methods for advanced students in China Studies and other related disciplines. It also prepares students for their senior projects by guiding them through the process of qualitative research design. Students are introduced to key qualitative methods such as participant observation, interviewing, field-note taking, photography, and document and data analysis. This course will also discuss the moral, ethical and theoretical problems facing qualitative research as well as the particular challenges of doing field research in China."
"This course will focus on the emergence of two modern Chinas, that of the gentry and that of the people: 1) the re-emergence of Confucianism as ""this culture of ours"", eventually leading to the creation of lineage China in the 16th century; 2) the emergence of ""popular culture"", which includes a popular, increasingly state-supported pantheon of local gods, local festivals built around these gods, and popular literature (from the bianwen of the Tang to the xiaoshuo of the Ming)."
"This course examines the social problems that have emerged in contemporary China since the economic reform. With a substantive focus on inequality and social class formation, this course will analyze the shifting distribution of material assets, social status, and political power in today’s China."
"Many 20th century Chinese films were mainly concerned with issues of nationhood, identity, trauma, and a national past. In recent years, however, while some directors have continued to focus on the nation, others have chosen to look at the present, as well as the effects of globalization on Chinese society, culture, and cinema production. This course asks that students begin to understand Chinese cinema(s) as transnational, a triangular composite of Mainland, Taiwan, and Hong Kong cinemas that has also been influenced by Japanese and Korean cinema. Students will be introduced to Chinese film history and criticism via an examination of thirteen films directed by several of Greater China's most skilled directors."
"This course explores key themes and texts in Chinese literature from late imperial times to the present for advanced students with at least an introductory background in Chinese language and literature. It will focus on reading Chinese literary texts in translation alongside the original Chinese texts and will include readings in relevant literary criticism and cultural theory. Major themes may include representations of self, alienation, social class, gender, sexuality, colonialism, nation, “Chineseness,” diasporic identity, and post-modernity; the readings in critical theory may concern modernism, post-structuralism, cultural production, neo-Marxism, feminism, gender theory, post-colonialism, biopolitics, globalization, Lacanian analysis, and the discourse of the Sinophone."
"This course examines China’s changing roles in and approaches towards regional and world systems, with a particular focus on China in Asia and how China might fit into the changing global order. It outlines various theoretical approaches to regional and world systems and international order found in both International Relations and International Political Economy, to highlight differing interpretations of China’s international relations."
"This course examines the key aspects of China’s institutional reform and political-economic development since the 1980s. It reviews the major policy controversies on China’s system transition, and presents the frontier research from the academia, policy think tanks and international institutions. Students will gain a deeper understanding of why and how China has reformed; and to what extent China’s experience may be generalized as a model for other developing countries."
"This course will examine selected themes relevant to the rapidly changing Chinese economy of the past few decades, focusing, amongst others, on the changing consumer market and retail industry. Through lectures and research projects, students will learn about recent trends in specific industries."
"This course will examine key issues of urbanization and urbanity in light of Chinese experiences. Urban development in China since the economic reform has been transformative in its scale and pace of city-building and is a range of outcomes such as rapid economic development, growing income inequality, massive population mobility, and serious institutional challenges. After offering an overview of modern China’s quest for urbanization since the late imperial era, this course will focus on the massive and rapid urbanizing process in the post-reform era. Students will be exposed to diverse issues, such as migration, population control, land policy, housing reform, urban planning, spatial reconfiguration, social welfare, inner-city poverty, infrastructure and transportation, environmental protection, and public space. The readings, drawn from multiple disciplines such as economics, sociology, anthropology, history, political science, and urban studies will examine the socioeconomic, political and cultural factors that contribute to the process and its particularities in the late-socialist context. This course will also seek to draw comparative lessons from China’s experience to obtain a comparative understanding of the complex socioeconomic consequences and diverse patterns of urbanizing processes across the globe."
"This is a specialized course for students with an existing foundation on Chinese politics. The class examines major insights from comparative research on contentious politics and investigates how popular protest in China relates to, informs, and sometimes challenges these scholarly debates. Students will learn about the origins and dynamics of popular contention in China, investigate different dimensions of its impact on Chinese politics, and study the state’s strategies to manage and contain collective expressions of discontent."
"This advanced seminar studies “places of memory” in modern China, or the sites, museums, monuments, and memories of the past. It includes theoretical readings on history and memory, case studies of Hong Kong and Macau, and examples from twentieth-century China that include the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, Tiananmen Square, the Mao Mausoleum, and the museum town of Anren. Students will consider both official and unofficial history, and read primary sources. This reading and writing-intensive seminar will culminate in an independent research paper on a “place of memory” chosen by the student."
"This course studies student movements in China in the twentieth century, taking as its case studies the May Fourth Movement in 1919 and the Tiananmen Square student movement in 1989. It considers these two movements in detail, analyzes their historical, political, and cultural contexts, and examines their legacies. It is a guided research seminar, designed to introduce students to the study of history as an academic discipline and to prepare students for independent research."
"The goal of this course is to give advanced students with at least a basic knowledge of Chinese literature an opportunity to read deeply on one aspect of the field. Topics may be defined by historical period, literary genre, theme, or aesthetic or theoretical issue. In addition to the close reading and analysis of primary texts, students will be required to read relevant works of critical research."
"This course is meant to introduce students to the fundamental aspects of Chinese legal culture. Our investigation will begin with the myths and early discourses about how law should be conceptualized and continue through the legal reforms during the transition from the Qing dynasty to the early Republic era. Drawing on a number of different disciplines, we will explore the continuity and change between the debates and developments of the early history of Chinese law and the Qing legal system from the middle of the nineteenth century onwards."
