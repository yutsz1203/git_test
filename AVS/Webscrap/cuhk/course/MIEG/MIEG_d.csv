"The course covers Linear-time Invariant Systems, Convolution, Dirac delta functions, Fourier Analysis of Continuous and Discrete-time Systems, Sampling Theorem, Fast-Fourier Transform, Laplace Transform, Z-Transform, and Fourier uncertainty principle. There will be emphasis on the interplay between mathematical ideas in MATH courses and engineering applications. Ideas such as inner product spaces, Contour integration, Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, Spectral decomposition, etc. will be employed for obtaining various results."
"The course covers the following two related topics. Discrete Structures: Graphs, Combinatorics - sums and asymptotics, recurrences, counting Probability: Random Variables and Probability density functions, conditional probability, independence, expectations, Markov and Chebychev inequalities, laws of large numbers, Random Walks, basic Markov Chains."
