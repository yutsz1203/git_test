"The importance of sexuality education is not merely the communication of facts, but the clarification and establishment of values. Unfortunately, this is exactly the reason why adults, including parents and teachers, often avoid frank discussions about sexuality with young people. In short, adults themselves are trapped in various contradictions and myths about sex in society, which often renders them ineffective in communicating their views and values to youth, providing high-quality sexuality education, and proactively setting effective school policies pertaining to sexuality-related behaviors.This course discusses various issues related to sexuality, particularly those that are relevant to young people. In-service and pre-service teachers will directly confront and analyze related values, identify common confusions and myths associated with youth sexuality, and examine how their own values might influence the approach they take to providing youth with education related to sexuality. Special emphasis will be given to topics that have direct relevance to adolescents’ sexual health and well-being, but are not typically covered in formal sexuality education curricula. Thus, as opposed to providing teaching methods or ready-to-use teaching materials for classroom demonstration, the primary aims are to raise educators’ awareness of these issues and to help them to proactively clarify their own values in advance of conversations with students. In doing so, they can avoid confusion, misinformation, or unsupportive responses when interacting with youth. By having clear concepts and values regarding sexuality, they can communicate accurate information, provide affirming and supportive guidance to students and advocate for evidence-based school policies in a way that best fits their own instructional contexts.Grade Descriptor: A - Outstanding performance on all learning outcomesB - High performance on some learning outcomesC - Good performance on some learning outcomesD - Satisfactory performance on the majority of learning outcomesF - Unsatisfactory performance on the majority of learning outcomes, or failure to meet specified assessment requirements(Individual course teachers may update the grade descriptors as and whenever necessary.
