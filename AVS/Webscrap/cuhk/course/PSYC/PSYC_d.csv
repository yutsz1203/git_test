"This course focuses on the theoretical, practical and cross-cultural issues related to the assessment of psychopathology and personality. Students will be exposed to a variety of clinical evaluation protocols used for the collection of data in order to evaluate the psycholopathological status of an individual. They will learn about the application of these techniques to a wide range of clinical psychological problems as stipulated in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorder Version 5 (DSM-V). These include mental state examination, test administration and interpretation, diagnostic decision making, integration of material derived from patient history and other sources, and comprehensive case conceptualization."
"The course will serve as the first introduction to behavioural and cognitive therapies and emphasize both theoretical and practical training. It aims at training students basic competence to begin practising behavioural and cognitive therapies for adult psychological/psychiatric disorders. In the first part of the course, the general procedure of behavioural and cognitive therapies will be discussed, while in the second part, the application of behavioural and cognitive therapies to specific disorders, e.g., depression, anxiety disorders, substance-related disorders, personality disorders, and psychotic disorders, etc., will be elaborated. A substantial proportion of time during class will be allocated to discussing simulated therapy sessions on videotapes. The students are expected to do their own readings before coming to class. They will be required to make presentations on the application of behavioural and cognitive therapies to specific disorders, as well as on intervention studies regarding their efficacy and effectiveness."
"The course will emphasize both theoretical and practical training on work with children and adolescents. It first starts with a discussion on developmental psychopathology. Then, the major focus of the course would aim at training students basic competence to perform intake diagnostic interview, assessment, diagnostic formulation, case conceptualization, and treatment planning, as well as to practise psychological intervention in treating various childhood and adolescent psychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, anxiety disorders, and depressive disorders, etc., as illustration of the treatment processes. The course ends at discussing how to match and fine-tune common treatment processes to particular aspects of different disorders. A substantial proportion of the time during class will be allocated to discussing simulated therapy sessions and role-play on videotapes. The students are expected to do their own readings before coming to class."
"The course consists of two parts. The first part focuses on the clinical management of clients with a history of psychological trauma. The management of a client with trauma history is challenging. This difficulty comes from various aspects, including unstable therapeutic relationships, acute crises, and the intrusions of trauma memories. A series of topics are designed to cover these issues. The second part of the course is devoted to a process-oriented view of psychotherapy. Process-oriented treatment targets the general patterns and common factors of psychotherapy, especially the interpersonal transaction between a client and a therapist. Studying the process of psychotherapy is expected to increase the flexibility in clinical practice."

"This course introduces common neuroimaging methods in psychological research, e.g., EEG/ERP, MEG, structural and functional MRI, fNIRS and EROS. Specifically, biological basis of the brain signals measured, physical principles underlying the imaging methods, signal processing techniques, experimental design for neuroimaging studies, pre-processing procedures, statistical analyses, and interpretation of imaging data will be discussed. This course emphasizes both theoretical and practical aspects in the application of neuroimaging methods."
The focus of this seminar is to critically examine current issues and controversies in the areas of personality and social psychology. Recent theoretical developments and emerging viewpoints are emphasized.
