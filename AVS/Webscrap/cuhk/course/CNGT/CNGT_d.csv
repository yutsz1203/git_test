"The course introduces the basic concepts, methods and tools used in bioinformatics including bioinformatics databases, sequence alignment and phylogeny, protein structure prediction, protein-protein interaction, molecular dynamics and other essential data mining algorithms with the aim of helping students to use bioinformatics tools and data to answer biological questions and to solve clinical problems."
"Genetic counselling is a communication process which involves [1] conveying medical facts including diagnosis, course of the disorder and available treatment[2] understanding the pattern of inheritance and the risk of carrying the gene in specific relatives [3] understanding the alternatives for dealing with the risk [4] choosing an appropriate course of action by taking into account their risk, family goals, ethical and religious standard, and in accordance with their decision[5] making the best possible adjustment to the disorder of the affected family member and/or the risk of recurrence of the disorder."
"This course focuses primarily on hematological malignancies including leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma, and will cover their pathogenesis and use of molecular and cytogenetic techniques for diagnosis, prognostication and treatment."
