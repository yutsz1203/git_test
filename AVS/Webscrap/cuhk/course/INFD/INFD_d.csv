"This course is designed to develop basic knowledgebase in infectious diseases in the society, in contexts of causation, impacts, diagnosis and epidemiology."
This course is designed to strengthen knowledge in microbiology and infectious diseases in public health contexts.
This course is designed to strengthen knowledge in microbiology and infectious diseases in public health contexts
"Students would be introduced to the principles and practice of infection control in three settings–hospital and clinic, laboratory and the community, through a series of lectures tailored to the needs of public health professionals. The emphasis would be on the development of a systematic approach to infection control practice."
Students learn to apply the science of epidemiology to solve practical real life problems related to the surveillance and outbreaks of infectious diseases
This course is designed to consolidate the knowledge base in infectious diseases epidemiology for application in public health practice.
"""Geographical information system (GIS), integrating cartography, statistical analysis, and database technology, has been widely applied in the study of public health, for example, disease surveillance, risk assessment, and decision making for public health practices. This course aims to offer a general introduction to GIS, including basic concepts, methodologies, and applications of GIS in public health issues.No special prerequisite for this course. Class size can NOT be larger than 40."""
"Introduction to the major tropical infectious diseases and neglected tropical diseases (NTD) of poverty, as well as the current control strategies at the global and regional levels"
"This course intends to provide an overview of the bioinformatics analyses for health management and epidemiological studies. Content of this course includes to examine the current knowledge and strategy for managing information of patient- and pathogen-specific covariates and genetic information to understand disease progression or host-pathogen interaction. Key issues in i) Genetic Association Studies, ii) Network Analysis, iii) Deep Sequencing Applications and iv) Phylogenetic Analysis will be addressed in this course."
"The course offers a learning opportunity to students who are interested in the public health control of infectious diseases in the local context. In addition to learning about the work of the Centre for Health Protection (CHP), Department of Health, the Module coordinator would guide students with discussion and tutorial."
