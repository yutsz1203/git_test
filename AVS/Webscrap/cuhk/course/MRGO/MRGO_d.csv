"An introduction to the current techniques and technologies for diagnosis of musculoskeletal disorders and the principles of management, with coverage over non-operative means, alternative medicine, and also principles of surgical intervention especially for arthritis and aged problems."
"Pain in particular chronic pain of the musculoskeletal system is closely linked to psychosocial consequences of disability and proper management is the key to rehabilitation. The new arrangement will provide a holistic approach, and enables participants to explore more deeply the psychosocial issues that arise from musculoskeletal impairments and disabilities and to prepare them for further studies in health counseling or behaviour therapy. In addition the causes, nature and types of musculoskeletal pain are discussed, and introduction to management including the psychosocial interventions, medications, interventional treatments and alternative treatments including Chinese medicine."
"Introduction of geriatric in falls: medical assessment, gait disorders, comprehensive geriatric assessment, and long term care, anti-ageing and exercise, perioperative management of hip fracture patients: medical aspects, dementia and delirium, nutrition and wound, neurological conditions: stroke and parkinsonism, osteoporosis and sarcopenia and peri-discharge and post discharge planning and support. Introduction to evaluation and management of daily self care activities; quality and outcome measures of rehabilitation, rehabilitation of geriatric patients, rehabilitation of specific disorders, etc."
This course aims to provide basic knowledge of biostatistics and research methodology.

"Fundamental and common clinical knowledge and management of orthopaedics in elderly and geri-orthopaedic co-management, including epidemiology, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, sarcopenia and related problems, including their clinical presentations, barrier management and prognosis."
"This course aims at develop the professional knowledge and skill of students in providing comprehensive care for common geriatric orthopaedic conditions (degenerative disease, fracture and spinal problems) and to effectively manage the common geriatric syndromes (such as delirium, incontinence, and malnutrition) among this disease cohort. The course also develops the students’ ability to apply evidence-based care models for fall prevention and end-of-life care promotion."
"Introduction to surgical treatments to various degenerative orthopaedic conditions such as total joint replacement, fragility fracture fixation and spinal surgery etc."
"Introduce the geriatric care of musculoskeletal system including assessment of the functional, cognitive, and affective status of older patients, and evaluating their needs for better management. Common medical diseases will also be deliberated with case studies specifically in metabolic bone and joint diseases."
"This is an introduction to the spectrum of musculoskeletal disorders and Rehabilitation issues related to principle of management and community rehabilitation to the physical disability; the psychosocial well-being of care providers; Impairment, disability and social standing: assessment and function; Management of specific medical and musculoskeletal problems such as chronic medical condition, musculoskeletal and cognitive impairment; Occupation assessment and the work environment; Assessment of work capacity and impairment; Medico-legal issues of Work Injuries, Return to work programmes and barriers."
The applications of rehabilitation technology in spinal cord injury and amputation for musculoskeletal disorders.
"Assessment and rehabilitation requirements for different body regions will be covered systemically, highlighting their special requirements. This would include rehabilitation for tendon and nerve injuries in the upper extremities, rehabilitation of ligamental injuries in the lower limbs (especially related to sports injuries), and back rehabilitation. Special issues will cover rehabilitation for joint replacement, major and multiple fractures (e.g. pelvic fractures)"
