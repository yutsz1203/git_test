"This course serves as an introduction to epidemiology for students with health services or healthcare experience. The course gives a general overview of epidemiology and biostatistics, including theories and methodologies, and applications in health services management and other healthcare sectors. The course provides the basis for further studies."
"This course will introduce basic epidemiology to students including introduction to epidemiology, applied health research methods, designing and conducting epidemiological studies (descriptive, case-control, cohort, clinical trials and meta-analysis)."
"This is an intermediate module which builds on the content of Introduction to Epidemiology (EPID5001). This module aims to provide students with further knowledge on cross sectional studies, cohort studies, randomized controlled trials, and systematic reviews."
"Students shall learn how to conduct common statistical analyses of epidemiological data by using SPSS or other statistical software and to prepare scientific reports for publication. Sessions will consist of brief introduction of the concepts, computer demonstration and data analysis practicum. The session on reporting will be introduce international guidelines for drafting publications for systematic reviews and randomized trials."
"The course will include a series of tutorials for appraising the methods of commonly used epidemiological study designs. In each tutorial, a published study of a specific design (e.g., randomized controlled trial) will be selected and presented and questions regarding the methods of the study will be asked. Students need to carefully read and discuss the questions beforehand and further discuss with the tutor and peers in the class."
The course involves a series of guest lecture seminars in which methodological aspects of various areas of epidemiological research are discussed and elaborated.
"In this course, you will learn about the methods used to assess dietary intakes and how to overcome limitations in assessing such a complex ‘exposure’. Nutrient intakes and dietary patterns in different population groups will be illustrated and key diet-disease associations will be presented. Finally, some of the challenges in interpreting nutritional epidemiology evidence and practical issues in communicating findings will be covered."
"This course is an advanced module for students who are interested in conducting systematic review and meta-analysis. It emphasizes on practical knowledge and skills needed for doing this kind of research: performing exhaustive literature search to identify relevant studies, extracting data from eligible studies, assessing risk of bias, synthesizing data, including meta-analysis, presenting results graphically and tabularly, investigating heterogeneity and potential biases, and publishing manuscripts in peer-reviewed journals. Tutorial materials will be distributed to students for their in-class exercises. Students will be enabled to master the essential skills for doing systematic review and meta-analysis by the end of this module."
"This advanced module introduces the concept of digital epidemiology with new forms of health data and real examples for disease management. The traditional epidemiology consists of studying various risk factors of the general population to study incidence and prevalence. The field of digital epidemiology is new, but has been growing rapidly with the increasing amounts of data generated on the internet, wearable devices, and mobile APPs. Students will explore the feasibility of applications through different real digital examples, including the consideration with data privacy and protection."
"This course is designed to enable post-graduate students who have a background in infectious diseases epidemiology to practice their skills in the real-life problem in infectious disease epidemiology. Contemporary statistical and mathematical methods will be introduced for the study of infectious disease epidemiological data. The course is illustrated with many topical examples including COVID-19, SARS, and influenza."
