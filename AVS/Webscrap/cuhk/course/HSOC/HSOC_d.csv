"Description Public health nutrition is the promotion and maintenance of nutrition-related health and wellbeing of populations through organized efforts and informed choices of society.

In this course, students will be introduced to various essential elements of food and nutritional sciences. The current nutrition issues at both local and global levels will be discussed. The application of these on promoting nutrition health of the population will be illustrated."

The macroscopic and microscopic perspectives in understanding the issues of health and illness in context are important in the course of service delivery and policy making."
