"This course explores the history of psychology, with an emphasis on the history of the science and practice of educational psychology, so as to offer EP Trainees important perspectives about the past, present, and future of the field. In addition, ethical principles of psychologists and codes of conduct, including standards of practice that are core to professional educational psychology, as well as relevant legal issues are reviewed and discussed. This course also examines current trends and issues salient to professional educational psychology in Hong Kong and worldwide, such as the evolving roles of professional educational psychologists in response to changing societal and individual needs."
"Professional educational psychologists play an important role in supporting children with special needs in both regular and special school settings. This two-course series on special needs is designed to enhance the professional capacity of EP Trainees in collaborating with teachers and parents to facilitate the personal, social and educational development of students with diverse needs. Drawing on recent research developments, these courses attempt to demystify misconceptions in findings related to special needs. They show how the latest research improves our understanding of the mechanisms underlying different kinds of special needs and discuss the implications of these empirical studies for developing effective interventions. In this course, we introduce the contextual foundation for understanding students with diverse needs by looking at their families and schools. We then focus on the needs and characteristics of children and adolescents with different intellectual and learning abilities or disabilities. In particular, we examine topics related to global cognitive impairment, developmental delay, specific learning difficulties, and individuals who are gifted and talented."
"Building upon the analytic framework developed in EPSY 6102, the course focuses on two broad areas of special needs: emotional and behavioral challenges, and physical and sensory disabilities. Emotional and behavioral challenges addressed include but are not limited to attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder, conduct problems, affective disorders, and autism spectrum disorders. We also look into the special needs arising from hearing and/ or visual impairments and examine the complex nature of physical disabilities and their subsequent impact on student development. EP trainees will be introduced to how the latest research improves our understanding of the mechanisms underlying different kinds of special needs and discuss the implications of these empirical studies for developing effective interventions in working with school children."
"This course provides a framework for identifying learning and clinical issues which specifically occur during lifespan development from childhood through adolescence and young adulthood. It also allows EP trainees an opportunity to lead and participate in scholarly and didactic discussions of educational and clinical issues relevant to developmental psychology, and to the Hong Kong context."
"This course is designed to facilitate EP Trainees’ self-awareness of diversity issues in educational settings, which is of importance to the professional competency of educational psychologists. During the course, EP trainees are expected to actively engage in trainee-led discussion and experiential activities that increase their knowledge, sensitivity, critical thinking, and skills repertoire in handling diversity issues in their educational psychology practices."
"This is part one of the two courses in psycho-educational assessment aiming at equipping students with the necessary knowledge and skills in the administration and interpretation of standardized assessment instruments, and the use of comprehensive assessment data to assist in making decisions on the delivery services to individuals with special needs. This course covers the basic concepts of intelligence and intellectual assessment. There will be administration, scoring, interpretation and report writing on some of the widely used instruments in Hong Kong. This course will also enable students to develop knowledge and skills to use academic-based achievement measures in school settings for students with specific learning difficulties or exceptional abilities, and discusses curriculum issues that are closely linked to the choice of measures and understanding of test scores. Overall, this course emphasizes the importance of collecting and using comprehensive data on individual’s cognitive functioning to make evidence-based decisions for effective intervention."
"This course focuses on behavioral, social and emotional assessment. EP trainees will learn to administer, score and interpret behavioral and personality measures including objective assessment tools and projective measures. Different measures with respect to their purposes and appropriate use will be discussed, and their impact of cultural, language and socioeconomic factors will be examined. Building upon the foundations acquired from Psychoeducational Assessment (I), this course discusses ways to integrate data from measures of cognitive abilities, academic performance as well as those from social and behavioral ones to obtain an overall understanding of students’ psychological functioning."
"This course equips students with practical knowledge and skills in assessment and intervention when working as an educational psychologist in a variety of education and social service settings. It also covers skills and strategies in conducting interviews, observing behaviors, administrating tests of various types, writing reports, and making recommendations to individual cases. Site visits and guest lectures will be arranged to widen EP Trainees’ perspective in their roles as an educational psychologist in school-related settings."
"This course examines intervention strategies and programs for meeting the needs of students with educational, emotional, behavioral and social adjustment difficulties. Students learn how to use instructional, behavioral and inter-disciplinary approaches as theoretical backdrops to design, deliver, and evaluate psychoeducational programs in school and community settings. Issues related to curriculum-based evaluation and curriculum designs are also discussed."
"This course aims to introduce to students a broad array of theories and perspectives that are foundational to psychological interventions for children and adolescents. We will evaluate major theories in working with school-age youngsters and their families, including cognitive-behavioral approaches, solution-focused brief counseling, systems and ecological approaches, family counseling, creative arts therapies, mindfulness, and career and vocational counseling. Strategies in working with children and adolescents with special issues (e.g., depression and suicidality) are also addressed. Throughout the course, students are encouraged to (1) adopt theory-based practice, and (2) examine relevant literature and use a scientist-practitioner model to evaluate the effectiveness of different approaches in working with clients from a wide range of backgrounds."
"This course is the second part for skills training. It provides a platform for students to further polish their micro-skills that are required in their practicum. In addition to basic assessment skills, other skills to be covered include crisis management, inter-disciplinary collaboration, working with the 3-tier support at school, counseling, and systems-intervention. Guest lectures and mini-workshops will be arranged to further equip students with practical skills in conducting interventions with individuals and in group settings. EP Trainees are expected to be actively engaged in small group practice and role play exercises throughout the course."
"This course examines the role of educational psychologists as consultants and systems-change agents, whose charge is to strengthen the capacity of various interlocking systems (e.g., school and family) that have an impact on students’ well-being and development. Consultation theory, problem-solving models, and a variety of sequential consultation strategies to facilitate systems-change are explored, including data-based decision-making and target identification, solution generation, and solution implementation. The role of educational psychologists as external consultants in schools to facilitate crisis management and prevention is discussed."
"This course is the third part for skills training. It serves as a platform for EP trainees to polish micro-skills that are required in their concurrent practicum. Specific focuses include case formulation, group facilitations, inter-disciplinary collaborations, consultations, and systems-intervention. This course also provides a forum in which experienced educational psychologists and allied professionals can share their specialities and expertise with EP trainees."
"This course is the last series of skills training. It serves as a platform for EP trainees to further polish micro-skills that are required in their concurrent practicum. It also provides them with opportunities to seek support and guidance for the challenges they come across in practicum. In addition, it is a forum in which educational psychologists and allied professionals from the field can share with the students their experience in difficult cases and latest development in intervention. EP trainees will also be guided to develop a personal career development plan for their long-term professional and personal growth."
"This course introduces a number of ways in which research in educational psychology are commonly conducted, with special attention being paid to the role of the scientist-practitioner. The focus will be on evaluating a range of statistical softwares (such as SPSS, MPlus, AMOS) and research methods used by educational psychology researchers to inform decision making within a multi-tier system. Both quantitative and qualitative methods will be discussed. The translation of research findings into the professional practice of educational psychology is emphasized."
"This seminar is the first course in a two-course dissertation sequence. EP trainees participate in individual or small group tutorials that guide them in utilizing knowledge and skills in research methods and statistics to conduct a dissertation research project. Emphasis will also be on helping students appreciate the need for evidence-based practice, supported by program evaluation of efficacy and effectiveness as indicated by intervention research relevant to professional practice in educational psychology. This course will guide EP Trainees toward completion of a dissertation proposal."
This seminar is the second course in a two-course dissertation sequence. Tutorial is conducted on an individual or small group basis to guide EP Trainees toward the completion of their dissertations.
