"In contemporary Japanese society, rules and guidelines govern discourses and practices of romance and affection. This course discusses how ideas from contemporary Japanese popular cultural texts (comics, novels, television dramas, nonfiction guidebooks, websites, social networking services, and others) influence the thinking and culture of human beings. The course also explores how the rules and styles of love are continuously modified, negotiated, and performed, particularly in an urban context. Further, the course considers the metamorphosis of intimacy and how this affects life in the postmodern era. Students are expected to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of love in Japanese culture and how concepts of love influence urban life."
"This course introduces the social scientific study of gender, sexuality, and family in Japan from the postwar to the contemporary period from a comparative perspective. As the course covers a lot of readings, writings, and discussions on the issues of gender and sexuality, students are expected to come to class prepared to discuss the readings and facilitate the class discussion. For many, Japan represents a sweeping stereotype of extreme gender norms vis-à-vis contemporary Euro-American gender norms and manifestations. Such stereotypes are employed not only by outsiders to critique the society ethnocentrically, but also by some natives as well. Both sides frequently comment on the ways gender and gendered expectations shape and even determine contemporary experiences of “being Japanese.” Furthermore, stereotypes about gender and sexuality in Japan frequently overlap with and draw from broader stereotypes about Japan vis-à-vis other Asian societies and Asian societies vis-à-vis Western societies.By identifying these stereotypes and also critically questioning what gender means and how it is being shaped in and shaping contemporary Japan, this course will offer an entry into theories of gender studies and sexuality, and also introduce tools to critically analyze cultural differences manifested in the issues of gender and sexuality while at the same time learning more about Japanese society and your own society. Moving between historical and contemporary definitions of gender, sexuality, and family to look at change and continuity of gendered life ways in Japan, the course is divided into five sections addressing issues of: 1) Defining Gender and Gender Stereotypes; 2) Gender and Social Institutions; 3) Gender Construction / Performance; 4) The Politics of Sexuality and Identity; and 5) Gender and “Marginality.” In each section we investigate cultural constructions of gender, sexuality, and family and key themes that revolve around them: identity, class, morality and life course in contemporary Japan. At the end of each section we will take time to reflect on gender and sexuality in Asia more broadly. Class sessions will consist of lecture sessions devoted to explaining the readings in context and tutorial sections for facilitating active discussions and student presentations. Assignments for the course will ask students for active participation and weekly discussion questions, a reflective mid-term essay, and a final exam."

"This course examines the making of Japanese foreign policy and diplomatic initiatives from the early postwar period to the present from historical, sociological and political science perspectives. In particular, the current shift from US-Japan bilateral relationship to Japan-China triangular relationship as the cornerstone of Japanese diplomacy will be closely investigated. The first part of the course aims to provide an academic framework for the study of Japanese diplomacy, such as the mechanism in foreign policy making, the interplay between diplomacy and domestic politics, and the rise of soft power and cultural diplomacy. The second part introduces Japan’s foreign policy with US, China, and ASEAN. The third part deals with traditional and non-traditional security issues as well as regionalism."
"This course aims to provide students with knowledge and framework of analysing the on-going process of regional integration in East Asia and Japan's role exercised in the process.

"This course explores modern Japan, which underwent perhaps the most striking transformation of any country in the modern world. Narrowly escaping colonization, Japan transformed into one of the most important imperial and economic powers in the world. Modern Japan is also doubly fascinating for a comparative take on the great themes of modern global history: the social upheavals and transformations of capitalism and democracy, the rise and fall of modern imperialism, the experience of total war, and the spread of a mass consumer culture. This course examines the invention of new traditions and the construction of a new national identity, the rise and fall of empire, the devastation of World War II, and the astonishing postwar economic growth and puzzling stagnation in contemporary times. This course explores how people in Japan have dealt with the dilemmas of modernity that challenge us all."
"World War II remains the most total and bloodiest conflict in world history. Fought on multiple fronts on three continents, the war witnessed a complex mesh of ideologies and war aims. It wrought unparalleled destruction and targeted civilians to an unprecedented degree. It has been the only war to date in which atomic weapons were used. The war pitted empires against each other and led to the fall of many of those global empires. This course will focus on World War II in Asia. It uses Japanese history as a window into global processes, and also places the war in its proper regional context. Beginning with World War I, this course journeys through the crisis of East Asian international relations in 1920s and 1930s to the outbreak of a multi-front war in East and Southeast Asia. It considers the war’s impact on empires and nations, soldiers and victims, and peoples throughout the region. And it explores the legacies that remain visible across the region today."
"Though extensively influenced by ancient China, Japan has developed into one of the world’s most distinctive cultures. Japan’s remote geographic location made it possible for changes to come relatively slowly, and except for the postwar reform, most innovations resulted from the voluntary adoption of foreign cultures rather than external pressure. This course discusses how Japanese civilization, i.e. the Yamato nation, and the Japanese language were formed. How Japanese society arose through the localization of foreign cultures will be one of the major themes covered. Efforts will be made to identify nation-wide characteristics, if any, and investigate how they were cultivated over the centuries. Special attention will be paid to the similarities that can be found between the two major social reforms in modern Japanese history, i.e. the Meiji Restoration and postwar reform, and to the question of how these reforms influence Japan society today."
"This course aims at examining the dynamics between everyday life, modernity, and the representation of tradition in modern Japan from two different perspectives. Part One of the course introduces students Japanese responses to the idea of modernity, and the cultural transformation and social crisis over the course of Japan’s modernization. Part Two examines the continuation of, rapprochement with, and appropriation of traditional elements in the cultural lives of contemporary Japan."

It will explore the emergence of a Japan influenced youth popular culture in Asia as well as the particular local contexts in which the experiences of youth take on meanings for individuals."
"This course offers an advanced seminar on Japanese popular and mass culture from anthropological perspectives. Thus this is not a survey course of different kinds of popular culture in Japan, but rather this course requires us to theoretically engage in social theories of popular/mass culture and analyze interpretations of meanings and forms of particular “popularly massified” socio-cultural phenomena in Japan.The course first provides literature on the major classical and critical theories of the “culture industry” in Europe as well as the formation of mass society in Japan. Next, we will analyze the forms and meanings of the diverse, popularly massified culture of production and consumption by examining anthropological works on Japan. Specifically, this course examines the issues of popular culture and mass culture through four different spheres: culture industries, media consumption, material culture and fandom, and globalization. Through analyzing these four spheres, the course also traces the thematic issues of gender, class, and cultural politics in the context of modernization and globalization. These issues provide the underlying structure and symbols that demonstrate how anthropologists approach a particular representation of complex popularized cultural movements under late capitalism."
"This course aims to explore the possible motivations and political backgrounds underlying the production of films that are related to WWII in East Asia, following the end of the Cold War, that is, during and after the 1990s. The intention is to analyze whether the demise of the Cold War has provided a more favorable time for Japan, China and the US to re-examine WWII in a fresh light. The year 1990 marks a watershed for geopolitics. In that immediately prior to and after 1990, the world witnessed many historical events still thought of as the most significant in recent history, even today. Such events as regards East Asia include the Tiananmen Incident, the burst of Japan’s bubble economy, the disintegration of the USSR and the rise of China. Security concerns among China, Japan and the US changed following 1990 in that Russia is no longer thought of as being a common threat of such primary importance as was the case with its predecessor state, the USSR. There is today a renewed sense of nationalistic assertiveness that can be seen in disputes in and amongst Japan, China and the US over history, territories, military expansion and in conflict over trade between these economic giants. At the same time, in the last twenty years, there have been frequent productions of movies related to WWII in East Asia, on events where differing views of history cause controversy, such as the Nanjing Massacre, Pearl Harbor and Hiroshima. There is therefore importance in investigating to what extent these movies are a reflection of such nationalistic sentiment, as well as the extent to which the WWII theme in filmmaking for a popular market is a tool for groups harboring specific political and ideological agendas. This course emphasizes interdisciplinary research and study methods, including film criticism, history and cultural studies. Students are required to choose a related topic at the beginning of the course and present his/her ideas in the last two lessons. Based on the presentation, students are required to submit a paper of about 3,000 words in the end of the semester, indicating their appreciation and understanding of the lecture materials and required readings."

"This course explores both linguistic structures and sociolinguistic features of the Japanese language. The first half of the course will discuss sociolinguistic features in Japanese language such as the history of linguistic exchanges in the kanji (Chinese character) and lexicon between China and Japan among other case studies, application of linguistic politeness expressions and word formation. The second half of the course will discuss the major linguistic features in Japanese language such as its grammatical structures and semantic features in the Japanese language. Linguistic approaches will be the principal analytical tools employed in this course. This course is designed for students who have completed elementary Japanese language courses and are interested to know more about the structure of the Japanese language and its sociolinguistic characteristics. At the completion of the course, students will have gained a better understanding of the structure of the Japanese language in general situations and will have learned how to apply language usage according to Japanese linguistic social norms."
"This course aims to understand and analyze Japanese philosophy, which is an important topic for reflecting on the roots of Japanese intellectual history and contemporary philosophical debates. Three areas will be discussed: 1) Japanese intellectual traditions such as those found in Buddhism, Confucianism and Shinto/Native Studies thought; 2) modern Japanese philosophers such as Nishida Kitaro, Kuki Shuzo and Watsuji Tetsuro; and 3) contemporary Japanese thought: Karatani Kojin, Post-311 philosophy, etc."
"This course explores the East Asian philosophical and religious traditions of Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism both from an internal perspective – how did each tradition represent its own values, goals, practices and methods of devotion – and external perspectives – how did the traditions spread across the East Asian subcontinent, assimilate with traditional cultural norms, and influence art and architecture. In addition to these so-called “three teachings,” we also discuss popular religion in South-east Asia, new combinatory religions such as Aum Shinrikyo and Cao Đài, and the impact of East Asian religious ideas on the West. We will also address religion in modern times, understanding how traditions continue to carve out roles for themselves in a secular world."
"Although Japanese language learners usually take the “standard language” of Japanese as the learning target, there are many dialects in Japan and they can represent the characteristics of culture in that particular area. This course introduces the structure of dialect by comparing the differences between the “standard language” and one representative example of Japanese dialects: the Kansai dialect. Students will learn how Kansai dialect reflects the culture and customs of the Kansai area through the perspectives of sociolinguistics. This course will use multi-media resources such as novels, T.V. soap dramas as teaching materials to illustrate the daily usage of the Kansai dialect."
"This course examines Japanese culture through anthropological perspectives. The course will consider how people in Japan experience family life, work and intimate relationships.

"Why is it that the same kanji can be pronounced in different ways? Why is it that some colours are expressed as adjectives whereas others as nouns? Why are there so many exceptions to Japanese grammatical rules? To answer these questions, we will study the cultural encounter between China and Japan, the kokufu or Japanese-style culture, the establishment of noble society in ancient times, and the history of Japanese literature. We will also study waka or Japanese poetry, which constitutes the core of Japanese literature.

"Regardless of the overwhelming influence from ancient China, Japan has developed into one of the world’s most distinctive cultures. Japan’s peripheral geographic location made it possible for gradual changes to occur based on its own internal needs. Except for the postwar reform, most Japanese innovations resulted from the voluntary adoption of foreign cultures rather than external pressure from foreign countries.This course explores how the Yamato nation and the Japanese language were formed based on hypotheses in related fields. How Japanese society arose through the localization of foreign cultures will be dealt with from a cultural historical point of view. Attempts will be made to identify nation-wide characteristics, if any, and investigate how they were cultivated over the past centuries.

The course also discusses how these reforms influence modern Japan society."
"Japanese economic growth has been one of the most remarkable success stories of the past century. Japanese business practices have emerged from Japan’s particular path to modernization and its capitalist conditions. What are the characteristics of Japanese capitalism? In what ways do capitalist economies differ from one another in their social organization, institutional embeddedness, gendered relations, and modes of governance? What are the challenges of such differences for management and economic performance in a competitive global economy? How have Japanese corporations responded to the processes of globalization and neoliberalization? In tackling these questions, we will analyze the issues of industrialization, globalization and neoliberalism as well as a broad range of topics, including those related to labor, industrial organization, the theory of the firm, management, gender, and economic reforms in Japanese society. Finally by examining the inside of the Japanese corporate world, we also learn some of the “techniques” that Japan had/has invented and introduced to the world. Thus this course challenges the common and presentist views of “Japanese business” and “Japanese corporations.” Instead it introduces the complex development of Japanese capitalism from the early 19th century to the present and examines ongoing transformations within Japanese capitalism."

"This course offers an advanced seminar on Japanese popular and mass culture from anthropological perspectives. Thus this is not a survey course of different kinds of popular culture in Japan, but rather this course requires us to theoretically engage in social theories of popular/mass culture and analyze interpretations of meanings and forms of particular ""popularly massified"" socio-cultural phenomena in Japan.The course first provides literature on the major classical and critical theories of the ""culture industry"" in Europe as well as the formation of mass society in Japan. Next, we will analyze the forms and meanings of the diverse, popularly massified culture of production and consumption by examining anthropological works on Japan. Specifically, this course examines the issues of popular culture and mass culture through four different spheres: culture industries, media consumption, material culture and fandom, and globalization. Through analyzing these four spheres, the course also traces the thematic issues of gender, class, and cultural politics in the context of modernization and globalization.These issues provide the underlying structure and symbols that demonstrate how anthropologists approach a particular representation of complex popularized cultural movements under late capitalism."
