This course covers selected topics in parallel/distributed systems. The detailed contents may be changed from year to year depending on the current development and the teacher specialty.
"This course will cover selected topics from: advanced pattern recognition, neural networks, expert systems and fuzzy systems, evolutionary computing, learning theory, constraint processing, logic programming, probabilistic reasoning, computer vision, speech processing, and natural language processing."
"This course includes fundamental topics in image processing, e.g., image enhancement techniques, color image processing, image segmentation and image compression. In addition, the course also focuses on topics concerning methodologies of recovering 3D information from 2D images. Specifi cally, techniques for camera calibration, stereopsis, motion analysis, pose estimation and structure from motion will be discussed. These techniques will have practical applications to virtual reality, model reconstruction and graphics."
"This course covers the key elements of the project management framework related to information technology. Topics include the identification of elements and processes of project management, processes involved in project integration management, project scope management, various tools and techniques used to develop project schedules and resource planning, processes of project quality management, project communications management, risk management, human resource management, and project procurement management. Experts from industry will also be invited to share their experience in the topics."
"This course introduces some basic concepts in computational finance. Topics include risk and return, modern portfolio theory, calculating the effi cient frontier, multiple factor models, various models for portfolio optimization, utility functions and evaluation of portfolio performance."
A series of 12 seminars on current topics in computer science to be presented by experts from academia or industry.
These courses involve a significant project in any area of computer science. A project report has to be written under the supervision of the lecturing staff.

"This course introduces the techniques used in data mining. Topics include clustering, classification, estimation, forecasting, statistical analysis and visualization. Data Mining provides useful tools for the analysis and visualization. Data Mining provides useful tools for the analysis, understanding and extraction of useful information from huge databases. Applications range from business, finance, medicine and engineering."
Issues of computer and network security. Weaknesses of network protocols. Security protocols. Firewalls. Computer viruses. System security threats. Applications of Cryptography.
"This course focuses on the programming issues in computer gaming software production, discusses the process in developing a game application and analyzes various considerations in technologies used. The main emphasis is on the real time performance requirement in computer game development. Indoor/outdoor rendering, networking, artificial intelligence, physics as well as the game design issues would be introduced."
"This course introduces decision theory and game theory used in computer science, in particular, artificial intelligence and multiagent systems. Topics include utility theory, decisions under risk, decisions under uncertainty, social choices, strategic games and Nash equilibrium, extensive games and subgame perfect equilibrium, repeated games and folk theorems, and applications in computer science."
"This course equips students with the skills on how to create, launch and run an IT business and to develop a coherent marketing strategy. The key topics include entrepreneur characteristics, identifying market opportunity, IT product/service management, business planning, formation of a new IT venture, financing, market segmentation, positioning, pricing, promotion, distribution and channel management."
"This course covers advanced topics in cloud computing. Topics will include new problems proposed in each year. Some topics to be discussed include: cloud computing models (e.g., SaaS, PaaS, IaaS); distributed and parallel data processing (e.g. MapReduce, Hadoop); data storage (cloud storage architectures, data centers, data deduplication); case studies of real-world cloud services (e.g. Amazon EC2, Windows Azure)."
"The high computational demands of deep neural networks (DNNs) coupled with their pervasiveness across both cloud and IoT platforms have led to a rise in specialized hardware and software techniques to accelerate DNN executions. This course will present techniques that enable efficient applications and computing of DNNs. The course will start with an overview of DNNs, and then will introduce various frameworks and architectures that support DNNs, as well as the implementations and optimizations on some particular computing platforms."
"The objective of the course is to allow students to acquire a basic understanding and the skills of the practical aspects of computer science. To qualify for the award of the subject credits, the student must attach to a company in a computer science related post as approved by the Professor-in-Charge for no less than 12 weeks. The student will have an academic supervisor as assigned by the Professor-in-Charge and an industry supervisor from the company. There will be a mid-term company visit by the academic supervisor. At the end of the internship, the student must give a presentation to the academic and industry supervisors, and submit a report summarizing what the student has done and learnt from the internship. The student's grade will be determined by (1) the presentation, (2) the student report and (3) a testimonial from the industry supervisor.The internship should normally take place in the summer term after a student has finished the first two semesters of studies. Part-time students can decide to undertake the internship in the summer term of either the first or second year of studies.Students are recommended to seek the Professor-in-Charge's comment on potential internship opportunities before enrolling in the course."
