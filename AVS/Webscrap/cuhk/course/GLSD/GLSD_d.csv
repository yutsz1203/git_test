"Two dimensions of theoretical approaches could be incorporated in GLSD1001. First, a general overview of theories approaching dynamics and changes of globalization could be covered in the first part of GLSD1001. Second, some specific theoretical approaches unique to respective cluster could be introduced after a general theoretical overview has been built. Four clusters on globalization are (1) Global Media and Popular Culture; (2) Global Economy; (3) World Politics; and (4) Planetary Health."
GLSD1003 is an extension of theoretical foundations students developed in GLSD1001. Debates and issues central to each cluster shall require students take up conceptual lens to explain causes and consequences of globalization with empirical findings by data and case studies. United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which are relevant to selected issues or debates for topics on globalization to be covered in the course. Seminars on four clusters shall be organized by guest speakers from respective clusters.
"The objective of this course to equip students with the analytic and research skills that are expected from an ethical and competent researcher in the field of global studies. Through mini-lectures, experiential learning activities and in-depth class discussions, students will learn why they should and how they can identify key problems in global studies, and design and carry out innovative and rigorous studies that offer informed solutions to the identified problems. Topics that will be covered in this course include: Research ethics in social science research; the Belmont principles; fallibility of commonsense; hypothesis generation; principles of scientific inferences; statistical reasoning; causal inferences; experimental simulation, controlled experiments, priming studies, survey, archival data analysis; and research presentation skills."
"This course is designed to introduce students the key concepts, issues, challenges and trends essential to understand the process of integrating global network. More specifically, this course offers an overview of the changing paradigm of global communication by studying the interrelation between cultural, economic, political, social, and technical dimensions of media and communication in the contemporary world, as well as examining the changing nature of power and the process of power diffusion in an information age. In doing so, this course will discuss the evolution of the transnational communication, the phenomenon of “electronic colonialism”, and the debate of New World Information and Communication Order (NWICO) etc. This is an interdisciplinary course, which covers the essential theories and concepts ranging from political science, international relations, media studies and communication.

The second part of this course will then critically assess the impact of the new way of world communication on international affairs and domestic events."
"(UGEC2351 is double-coded with GLSD2201.) Culture is in the air that we breathe and it is inevitable that people construct reality through their own 'cultural lens'. However, in this globalization era, people often have many cultural lenses. Through understanding the impact of globalization on cultures and societies, we will have nuanced understanding of how people from different cultures construct reality. Many scholars and activists argue that globalization will lead to a worldwide homogenized consumer culture dominated by Western values. Others believe that globalization can lead to the clashes of incorrigible cultures. Meanwhile, globalization has catalyzed formation of new hybrid cultures and fostered the blooming of creative cultural industries. In this course, we will explore the above topics through understanding the effects of globalization on personal identities, the economy, consumerism, and communication, etc. in the immediate and distal environment."

"(UGEC2354 is double-coded with GLSD2401.)  The course introduces the concept of human carrying capacity in the globe. The capacity symbolizes the balance between population size and environmental resources ––the underlying foundation for sustainable development. In history, it is shown that the human carrying capacity was periodically shrunk by climate deterioration and human-induced environmental degradation, resulting in catastrophic social consequences such as mass migrations, wars, or even population collapses. In this course, the background knowledge of climate-induced and human-induced environmental change will be introduced. The associated physical and social dimensions of environmental change will also be covered.

"People from all over the world are similar to and different from one another. Besides being individuals, they are also products of their culture—their psychological processes (i.e., thoughts, feelings, behavior, identities, beliefs, and assumptions) are shaped by their cultural backgrounds and experiences. In this course, we learn about how cultures influence and shape individuals’ psychological processes, what happens when individuals from different cultures meet one another (resulting from globalization), and when cultures meet one another within individuals (resulting in multiculturalism).The course will focus on timely, essential and at times sensitive and controversial topics central to the psychology of globalization, such as colonialism and how it shaped our psychological understanding of ourselves and others; how racism and stereotyping are psychological phenomena that interfere with successful globalization today; or how different moral cultures understand and often conflict with each other.This course adopts an introductory approach to cultural psychology and focuses on how our individual psychology interacts with an increasingly globalized world.
