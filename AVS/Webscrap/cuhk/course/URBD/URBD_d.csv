"This course will study urban economic issues associated with environmental and social issues within urban regions. The course will study this topic from an interdisciplinary perspective. A range of topics in urban economics will be discussed including planning policies related to urban environment, migration, and transportation, as well as, zoning and livability issues, and potentials for more sustainable, just and livable cities. Students will become familiar with contemporary urban economic research and online sources of economic data. The course will prepare students to develop criteria for value judgments about the complex social, economic and environmental impact of urban design and planning."
"This course examines the main ideas, histories and theories of the city through specific local and international examples from significant historical, political, geographical and environmental periods and aspects. Important themes and debates in urban design and planning will be critically explored to understand the relationship between the urban forms, the culture of cities and their sustainable development. In particular, the way urban forms have been used and reinterpreted, adapted and challenged by different social, economic and political contexts. Exemplary design projects and planning policies are investigated in view of their relationship to contexts and their impacts on communities and the environment."
"This course consolidates students understanding of academic inquiry and enables them to conduct a range of research methods relevant for the field of urban design. The first part of the course covers general aspects such as research ethics, scoping of research areas, conceptualizing research frameworks and identifying relevant research questions. The second part provides students with the relevant research methods and skills for urban design, such as conducting field studies, surveys and semi-structured interviews, as well as performing a range of qualitative and quantitative analyses. Throughout the course, students will learn how to relate their findings from their mixed-method studies to address complex urban issues. The course is coordinated with students’ work in the design studio and prepares them for their final thesis project. Assignments are organized according to sub-themes linked to the core issues of urban design."
UD Studio I will focus on existing urban districts in the Pearl River Delta region including Hong Kong and Macau and beyond. Students develop in groups and as individuals a design project exploring opportunities for neighborhoods and public spaces.
Urban Design Studio II focuses on the creation of a new urban area. Students develop in groups and as individuals on a design project.
"The course focuses on the urban processes involved in the development and redevelopment of cities. Through lectures and seminars key issues, problems and challenges associated with urbanization and current trends within regional and international context are discussed. The plan making process in Hong Kong including public engagement within the city and the wider PRD context is introduced. Current trends in urban transformation processes in other parts of the world are looked at through regional and international case studies."
"The course will provide an introduction into history and application of complex urban transportation systems that are globally in use or conception. It will provide introduction to transport concepts, planning aspects, technical requirements and ways of implementation."
"This course provides a base for understanding urban management including the political and socio-economic aspects of urban development, governance issues, planning, policy framework and decision making within a Western and Asian development context. Through a series of lectures and seminars students are introduced to urban management methods and strategies in key areas such as land management, environmental management and public services delivery including associated problems and challenges within the context of Hong Kong and the PRD region."
This course is organized as an intensive workshop and allows students to explore in teams with students and advisors from various international universities a specific issue of urban design. Different international urban conditions are explored through comparative analyses and design. Students can benefit from the exposure to different urban cultures and design approaches. The course also prepares students for a working practice in diverse teams and in different cultural contexts.
"This course introduces the principles of environmental design in order to maximise the comfort of occupants and minimise the environmental impacts due to the design of building, landscape and urban spaces. The effect of different environmental factors on the built environment is discussed in detail. Design features, such as building’s orientation and form, are closely related to the design details of other design features. The quantitative aspects of the interactions between various design details are discussed with practical examples demonstrating such effects. It also examines the applications of climate-sensitive and environmental urban design in enhancing the living quality as well as the health and well-being of citizens."
"This course covers the general procedures of theoretical inquiry as it relates to urban design, from scoping the research terrain, identifying and focusing on conceptual frameworks and research questions, to determining the techniques, scope and phasing of investigations, as well as criteria for the development of interpretations and paradigms. For the dissertation, students will develop a proposal and produce intellectually rigorous piece of written or designed work. The topic will be defined in discussion with advisors, either in relationship with the design studio, or as an independent research on a topic related to urban design."
