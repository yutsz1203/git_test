"This course offers an introduction to the theoretical aspects of mathematics teaching and learning in face of the challenge from the ever-changing mathematics curriculum. It will provide an overview of both cognitive and socio-psychological issues involved in both the teaching and the learning of mathematics. Topics include the psychological models or theories in the teaching and learning of mathematics; research on the teaching and learning of number, algebra, geometry, and calculus; developmental, sociocultural, semiotic, and approaches to the study of concepts and conceptual development; digital technology in mathematics teaching and learning; discourse and the situated nature of cognition; mathematical problem solving and problem posing; research on mathematics-related affect."
"This course aims at helping students develop an understanding of the impact of educational reform on mathematics education by an in-depth analysis of current issues pertaining to the mathematics curriculum and assessment. From the perspective of curriculum design, the local curricula in both primary and secondary schools are delineated. The changing goals of mathematics education are addressed with reference to the historical development. Worldwide trends in mathematics curriculum development are also reviewed. Mathematics achievement and the ever-changing development in the assessment of mathematics learning are discussed. Other relevant current issues in curriculum development and teacher professionalism may also be explored."
"This course is designed to raise the awareness of participants who wish to improve their teaching in mathematics lessons through recurrent hermeneutic cycles of researching process. Mathematics education research is to be explored with the focus being drawn on the discussion of teacher-as-researcher movement. Through critical reflection, the participants are to explore the sense-making process of mathematics learning via researching action in mathematics lessons."
"The participants are expected to conduct guided independent studies, and on completion, to submit a research report within the area of mathematics education. The exact titles of the projects of investigation and the supervision schedules are to be negotiated between supervisors and participant."
"Students will pursue independent study in selected topics and areas of mathematics education under the supervision of teachers as appointed by the board of the Faculty of Education. A student should only elect this course to fulfi ll the programme requirements if a required course is not offered within the normative study period of the student, and no other substitute can be found."
