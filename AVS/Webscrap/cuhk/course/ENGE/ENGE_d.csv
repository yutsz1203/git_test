"Using language is one of the most creative and distinctive of all the activities that make us human. Perhaps we are most aware of this kind of creativity when we read imaginative literature, whether classic or contemporary; but we also experience it directly in our own everyday language use. This course aims to foster new understandings of the various ways in which language influences and shapes the experiences of life common to all humanity. Students learn to analyze and appreciate a wide range of literary, linguistic and cultural phenomena, including the works of Hong Kong authors/poets who express themselves through English. From a linguistic perspective, we examine the ways in which language is structured and used creatively for different purposes in both local and global contexts. From a literary perspective, we study not only the traditional genres of fiction, poetry, and drama, but also film, song, and life writing. From a cultural perspective, we investigate how different texts and media are part of how we construct the world and define our evolving sense of self and our common humanity."
"This course provides you with the communication skills necessary to perform various academic and non-academic tasks in both online and offline contexts. It demonstrates how differences in audience, communicative purpose and medium shape the content and structure of various written and spoken genres. It also discusses different patterns of development such as narration, description, exemplification, and persuasion, and the importance of thesis statements and topic sentences in organizing ideas. To help you develop an awareness of the structural and stylistic differences of various genres, you will produce a personal reflective essay, a literary analysis paper, and a persuasive presentation, that will be presented in various print, face-to-face and digital formats, using both linguistic and multimodal resources. Through a process oriented approach, you will be producing outlines and drafts of these writing tasks, get feedback, and learn writing strategies such as using sensory details, choosing active, specific verbs, and employing cohesive devices. Recognizing how technology shapes communication practices in diverse ways, this course also draws attention to the affordances and constraints of digital tools such as WordPress, Blackboard, Zoom, and social media platforms."
"This course builds on the foundational communication skills introduced in ENGE 1310 and helps you develop the competencies necessary to conduct effective research. It examines the existing structures and conventions of various print and digital genres such as journal articles, blogs, infographics, and YouTube videos. It also discusses different patterns of development such as definition, problem/ solution, comparison/ contrast, classification and division, and the importance of maintaining an appropriate register and style. To help you produce and consume knowledge in creative and critical ways, you will construct an abstract, an annotated bibliography, a literature review, a video, and a research article that discusses an issue in applied linguistics. These texts will be constructed for real world audiences and will involve the use of various multimodal resources. Through a process-oriented approach, you will be producing outlines and drafts of these writing tasks, get feedback, and learn writing strategies such as signposting, using signal phrases, and constructing parallel structures. Recognizing the increasing importance of technology in producing and consuming knowledge, this course also discusses the use of various digital tools such as search engines, reference management software, blogging and video editing platforms."
"This course offers an overview of the linguistic structure of English. It systematically studies the English language at various levels: words, phrases, sentences and beyond. It also provides students with the opportunity to observe and explain the ways in which English is used in everyday life."
"This course is designed for English Majors who need some knowledge of the grammatical structure of contemporary English, and for those who may want to study English linguistics and English teaching courses which require such background information. It covers basic questions such as what grammar is and how one goes about studying the structure of English. Basic grammatical concepts and categories as well as the constituent structure are systemically introduced to equip students with the essential analytical tools."
"This course will introduce students to methods of reading literary texts from the major genres of fiction, drama, and poetry. The emphasis will be on specific literary texts, paying attention to their language, forms, conventions and meanings."
"The course will introduce students to what is involved in translating a dramatic text from the page to the stage. Students will analyse some one-act plays in English from a dramaturgical point of view, workshop them in small groups and perform them on the stage before an audience. They will be introduced to the adaptation of texts for performance, to the technical aspects of casting, acting, directing and stagecraft. Emphasis will be placed on communicative aspects of acting, including pronunciation, intonation and voice production. Drama in Performance will complement other major courses in communication, literature and language study."
"What is a hero? The stories we read, as well as the movies and television programmes we watch are full of heroism, but do we really know what a hero is? Does a hero have to be good? Do they have to be strong? Do they have to win in the end? Do we have to like them? This course will address many of these questions in relation to many different texts from a wide variety of media: from one of the earliest surviving texts of the ancient world, The Epic of Gilgamesh to the recent global phenomenon, Game of Thrones. We will look especially at the way heroes are shaped by the monsters that they do battle against. Some monsters are fought with fists and swords, but others must be defeated through other means for they lie within the hero himself."
"This is a course designed to integrate the skills used in the earlier communicative skills courses. In particular, students will be provided with opportunities to express their opinions and to practise using evidence, data and sources in the preparation of their own oral and written work. In addition, students will gain experience in seminar-related skills by presenting the fruits of their research to classmates through oral presentations."
"(UGED2195 is double-coded with ENGE2110.) This course takes a closer look at the genre of crime fiction. The course outlines a broad perspective of the genre of crime fiction from its earliest incarnations to modern-day TV drama. We will explore a variety of different forms of crime fiction, and how the genre more generally reflects cultural, historical and social issues. The study material for this course will consist of literary texts, TV series, and films drawn from the popular cultural canon. Topics we will discuss include conspiracy, serial crime, trauma, the epistemology of clues, history and crime, and the criminal mind. The course begins with a historical overview of detective fiction, and concludes with a creative workshop on how to write a detective story. Students with a taste for murder, crime, and suspense — and above all the desire to solve enigmas and mysteries — are welcome to attend this course."
"This course takes a closer look at the intimate connections between literature and human rights. The history of human rights has always been accompanied by literary texts; conversely, some of the most important literary texts in the world have focused on human rights issues. People who have suffered abuse and human rights violations have often articulated their painful stories in a variety of literary genres — in the hope of being heard, achieving recognition, bearing witness to events that have defined their lives. These stories thus constitute important documents around which rights campaigns and communities are built. During the course, we will look at the history of human rights literature, as well as various case studies — including Stolen Generation narratives in Australia, narratives by women who were forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese Imperial Army, political dissident narratives, and more recent refugee literature. No previous studies in literature needed to take this course. Students interested exploring the relevance of literary imagination and narrative for human rights discourse are welcome to attend this course."
"(UGED2186 is double-coded with ENGE2130.) Why read literature? This course offers a broad look through literary history to understand the enduring value and diversity of literature. For each lecture, we will look at a literary masterpiece — from antiquity to the present — and address three main issues: A) the work and its historical context; B) how to read it; and C) themes that make the work relevant in contemporary society and in our everyday lives. The course is designed as an introductory survey of literary works that have had a major impact throughout the ages. Issue A) is intended to give students a sense of the work’s impact in its own time; B) is designed to provide students with the conceptual tools and methodologies to understand a classic work of literature; while C) will provide students with an opportunity to make connections between their own individual concerns and those of the great characters of literature. At the end of the course, students will have encountered some of the most esteemed classics in literary history. No previous studies in literature needed to take this course. Students interested in discussing the ideas, ideals and values of classic literary texts are welcome to attend this course. NB: students are expected to read only EXCERPTS of the works. However, it is expected that students will read at least ONE full-length work (for the course essay)."
"(UGED2187 is double-coded with ENGE2140.) This course aims to provide a historical and cultural overview of the genre of superheroes and the Marvel empire. Narratives of superheroes began to circulate in popular culture during the 1930s with the DC comics phenomenon. The visual artistry and matching of illustrations with text and plot produced a uniquely new form of weekly reading material. The development of the DC and Marvel superheroes of the 80s and 90s built on Asian illustrated traditions and forged new relationships between East and West comics and graphics styles. Today, the genre is among the most dominant cultural forms worldwide. This course will introduce you to the comics and graphic novel literary genre and their movie spin-offs. The course will also have a workshop element and seek graphic and illustrated responses from students. Above all, the course will investigate the role of the superhero. Who is this superhero, or rather what is a superhero? Why does the fantasy of an individual with supernatural powers generate such fascination in modern society? These are some of the questions we will explore during this course. The genre’s transformations over the last nine decades reflect both political, cultural, and social changes. We will explore a broad variety of different superhero incarnations in both film, texts, and graphic novels. Subjects to be discussed include mythology, genre, science and technology, crime and vigilantism, identity, gender and sexuality as well as transnationalism and geopolitics. Anyone interested in popular culture, animation, DC comics, the graphic novel, fantasy and superheroes are welcome to attend this course."
"This course studies the relationship between words on the page and audio-visual moving images on the screen by focusing on the adaptations of classic English novels of the nineteenth century. We will look at several nineteenth-century English authors who have been particularly popular with screen adaptations: Austen, Dickens, and Hardy. By close reading of their texts and careful viewing of the big and small screen adaptations of these novels, we will consider the specificity of the textual and the visual media in the narrative, thematic, and aesthetic aspects. The course will explore the interaction between literature and film/television in terms of forms and stylistics, and make broader cultural and historical enquiries about the issues of gender, class, nationhood, and nature that will illuminate nineteenth-century literature in general and its relevance to the present."
"Focusing on song writers and performers from the USA, this course introduces students to the art of popular song lyrics of the twentieth century. In the process of studying American popular song lyrics, students will learn about such musical genres as “the blues,” “gospel,” “tin pan alley,” “folk,” “country,” and “rock and roll” as well as the elements of American history that give rise to each of these types of musical lyrics. Since one of the course elements is the relationship of musical lyrics to musical sound, we will spend considerable class time listening to popular songs , paying attention to the way a lyric’s meaning is conveyed through such elements as vocal style and musical arrangement."
"This interdisciplinary course of critical medical humanities examines contemporary literary and filmic texts that shape ethical thought about health and wellbeing. We will read major texts that problematize and hypothesize the relation between self and community; immunity and toxicity; power and medical interventions; faith and healing; and knowledge and narrative. This course aims to widen the “medical” beyond the scene of clinical encounter through close engagements with critical theory about the body and the self as embodied subjectivity. In our readings, we will discuss and debate the meaning and practices of responsibility, endurance, and imagination that challenge assumptions about the illness experience, caregiving, and the production of medical knowledge."
"This online course is designed to help students make the most of education abroad by enhancing their intercultural awareness and sensitivity as they explore the host environment and interact with locals and other international students. Except for a few pre-departure tasks, all work is done online while students are abroad. Through exposure to relevant theories, readings, and other resources, this course aims to help students develop a deeper understanding of what it means to be interculturally competent and global-minded as they immerse themselves in the host culture. While they critically reflect on their second language/intercultural interactions and share their experiences with peers, they are encouraged to become more curious, open-minded, and actively engaged in the world around them."
"(UGED2197 is double-coded with ENGE2190.) The course will consider myths and legends from around the world with particular sensitivity to one peculiar aspect of them: that the gods depicted in them often behave no better than the people whose lives they determine. In order to explain why this is the case, the course will seek to understand the nature and function of myth, and the complex uses to which they are put in order to explain some of our most pressing questions: How did we all begin? Where are we? Who are we? Why is there so much wrong with the world? What’s the solution? Where will we go when we die? How will it all end? Although the concept of myth might seem outdated in modern secular culture, by drawing comparisons between the ancient and contemporary worlds, students will be encouraged to see how myth-making of some kind is as inevitable and innately human as the questions which prompt it. The course will begin by establishing some archetypal similarities between myths – from myths of Creation to myths of Apocalypse – and then consider myths from specific cultures – including Greco-Roman, Scandinavian, and Chinese – before considering the appeal of myth in contemporary popular culture, especially The Lord of Rings, and Game of Thrones."
"This course explores the complex relationships between authors and the various forms of authority that they have written under, or written about. It will broadly consider the ways literature has been deployed to challenge socio-political authority, as well as to affirm, publicise, and legitimise it. More specifically, it will consider: literary representations of authority, literary attempts to deconstruct authority, political attempts to banish literature, literary strategies of speaking to authority, the use of literature to legitimise authority, and the ways literature can establish its own authority. Students will be encouraged to recognise that, though literature is popularly seen as a means to challenge authority, it has often also been used as an agent of authority. In fact, the words “author” and “authority” come from the same Latin root, auctor meaning “an originator, causer, doer.” What similarities are there between authorial authority and socio-political authority? To what extent do they make competing claims to legitimacy? And when do their separate claims to legitimacy come into alignment?"
"(UGED2199 is double-coded with ENGE2210.) This course takes a closer look at the intimate connections between song and poetry. The history of song has always been closely connected with the oral tradition in literature; conversely, the musicality of literature owes much to the song tradition. Gospel, Negro Spirituals, Folk Music, the Bard Tradition, the Sean Nós tradition, the ballad and the lyric form in poetry, as well as popular music and musicals will all be examined in this course. The course will examine the different song traditions in their social and political contexts. The course will also include a song-writing element. There will be a song-writing workshop with a well-known local songwriter. Students will be asked to write a song in any genre of their choice (folk song, protest song, spiritual song etc.) and then to have that song performed either by themselves or someone else in the class. No previous studies in literature or music are needed to take this course. Students interested in exploring the connections between song and poetry and between song-writing and the poetic craft are welcome to attend this course."
"(UGED2172 is double-coded with ENGE2220.) This course looks at the close relationship between existentialist philosophy and literature. Existentialism is a philosophical movement that focuses on human existence and the challenges of choice, freedom, and responsibility in the modern world. We will explore a variety of existentialist positions—including those of Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Sartre, and de Beauvoir—to understand how existentialist thought constitutes an important intellectual context for many themes in modern literature, including authenticity, alienation, and anxiety. Authors to be discussed include Kafka, Dostoevsky, Ionesco, Camus, Beckett and others. Students interested in literary representations of the existential challenges of the human condition are welcome to attend this course."
"After surveying the origins of English drama (morality and mystery plays, Senecan tragedy, the development of playhouses, etc.), tragedy will be discussed with particular attention paid to the ways in which playwrights of the period treat the theme of revenge, their tragic conception of the universe, and the dramatic techniques they employ. The Restoration period will deal with the heroic tragedy and the comedy of manners. Representative works by some of the following authors will be covered: Kyd, Marlowe, Tourneur, Webster, Middleton, Ford, Dryden, Otway, Wycherley, Etherege, Congreve, etc."
"The first half of this course will focus on representative European and American plays of the late-nineteenth and twentieth centuries and trace their significance in the development of modern and contemporary drama. The second half of the course will explore twenty-first century plays and their relationship to some of the most pressing questions of the contemporary period. As students become familiar with the major styles, concepts, and figures of modern and contemporary drama, they will also develop an awareness of the historical contexts from which the plays emerge and the social and cultural issues to which they respond. Finally, students will investigate drama as both a written text and a performance event and, through their readings, discussions, and assignments, gain an appreciation of its uniqueness as a “living” art form. The course readings will include plays by the following authors: Henrik Ibsen, Bertolt Brecht, Arthur Miller, Samuel Beckett, Caryl Churchill, Ayad Akhtar, Frances Ya-Chu Cowhig, and Lynn Nottage."
"This course introduces students to the rise and development of the novel as a genre in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when realism was widely accepted as the dominant mode of representing reality through fiction. Emphasis will be given to novelists such as: Defoe, Richardson, Fielding, Sterne, Austen, Dickens, the Brontës, George Eliot, Hardy and others."
"(UGED2194 is double-coded with ENGE2360.) This course will provide an outline of developments in children’s literature in England and parts of Europe through the study of some essential, central texts as well as recent books for children. The uses of fantasy and the educational aspects of books for children will be discussed, along with notions of childhood and the nature of children. Through close reading of set texts students will be able to engage in critical techniques applicable to most literature, for the best texts for children satisfy sensitive adult readers too."
"This course introduces students to some landmarks in the history of literature in English from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The relationship of literature to such concerns as urbanization, nationalism, empire, democracy, revolution, and the rapid growth of science and technology will be considered, together with the emergence of new female voices in literature. Special attention will be given to the rise of Western modernity, as reflected in the texts studied."
"This course introduces students to the distinctly modern features found in the development of the western novel in the twentieth century. Emphasis will be put on narrative representation as a way of capturing a consciousness specific to the modern age. Novelists to be studied will normally include: Conrad, Joyce, Woolf, Lessing, Lawrence, Beckett and others."
"This course provides an introduction to the art of reading poetry. We will read and analyze a range of poems of diverse styles and forms from the Renaissance to the present day so as to stimulate students’ creative and critical responses to poetry. We will also read and analyze contemporary poetry written in Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore. The course explores, among other topics, the role of the imagination, the act of writing, the purposes of poetry, the notions of tradition and of the individual talent, for these are issues with which poets engage, whether directly or indirectly, in their poems."
"This course introduces students to basic concepts in phonetics, the scientific study of speech, and in phonology, the study of sound patterns in various human languages with principal emphasis on the English language. Students gain an understanding of the articulatory mechanisms for producing consonants, vowels, as well as tone and intonation. The International Phonetic Alphabet and sounds from a variety of languages are introduced. In the phonology part of the course, students analyze the patterns governing the distribution of sounds in different languages. A major aim of this course is to enable students to transcribe English words and utterances and to develop an appreciation of the diversity and systematicity of sound structure in human language."
"This course takes as its premise that environmental writing is environmental action. Environmental writing is also political engagement (biopolitics, as it were) as the ultimate aim of environmental writing is to effect policy change to protect, nurture, and sustain the environment and humankind. In this course, we will explore how to use different modes and genres of writing to effect environmental change. We will first examine the major elements of environmental writing through the exploration of different modes and genres, including children’s books, blogs, essays, poetry, songs, social media, Apps, newspaper articles, and posters. We will then examine the major environmental issues we are facing globally and in Hong Kong, and examine how environmental writing is currently being used in Hong Kong to engage the public and effect change. We will also investigate public awareness of the major environmental issues facing Hong Kong, to develop an understanding of how we can engage the public more effectively through writing. Finally, we will engage in our own environmental writing by creating three pieces of environmental writing, each examining the same environmental issue through a different type of writing. Key questions this course explores:• How can we use writing to raise awareness of environmental issues and effect environmental change?• What are the most pressing local and global environmental issues we face today? How is environmental writing currently being used in Hong Kong to engage the public and the government to respond to these issues? How can we use writing more effectively to engage the public and effect environmental change?"
"(UGEC2188 is double-coded with ENGE2530.) The objective of this course is to give students an overview of the status, features, and use of Hong Kong English (HKE), the variety of English commonly used in Hong Kong. In the first part of the course, students will be introduced to the concept of ‘world Englishes’ and examine different theoretical frameworks for conceptualizing the evolution of new varieties of English. The course then examines relationship between Hong Kong English and Hong Kong culture from cultural, social, historical, and educational perspectives, particularly in relation to and juxtaposition from Cantonese and Putonghua. The second part of the course examines both spoken and written features of HKE, including grammar, discourse particles, vocabulary, and pronunciation, as well as the practices of code-mixing and code-switching. This section of the course also focuses on the social impact of the use of these features in Hong Kong culture. In the third part of the course, language attitudes and ideologies towards ‘standard’ language varieties (for example American and British English) in relation to HKE will be explored. The course will also examine the relationship between use of HKE and social identity as well as gender in Hong Kong culture."
"This course introduces the role linguistics and linguists play in forensic science and legal investigations. Forensic linguists are like the Sherlock Holmes of language – they offer their expert opinions about linguistic evidence in the legal process. This course introduces some major topics in forensic linguistics, including authorship analysis, speaker identification, trial discourse, plagiarism and collusion, and linguistic evidence in cybercrime. High profile cases where forensic linguists have contributed to legal investigations will be discussed. Students will also be introduced the methods and tools commonly used in forensic linguistic analyses of spoken and written data. No prior knowledge of law is required."
"(UGEC2189 is double-coded with ENGE2600.) Although English has long spread around the world, the consequences of this spread are only now beginning to be appreciated by speakers in diverse cultures and societies. English has changed the world, impacting specific local cultures in both positive and negative ways. But English has also been localized and acculturated, made to express the realities of diverse cultures and societies, and so the language has been changed in turn. The discourse of world Englishes aims to re-imagine our understanding of the language. The difference between error and innovation can no longer be decided by reference to ‘ownership’ of the language. Additionally, the language is beginning to be a medium of the expression of identity for more and more people in very different social and cultural contexts. World English must be pluralized, which is why we think in terms of world Englishes. This course is split into two sections. The first section will introduce you to issues in the discourse of world Englishes: innovation, variety, creativity, globalization, etc. The second section will look at specific case studies in different cultures and societies, and will focus on Asian Englishes, e.g. English in Singapore, China, and Japan. Different Asian cultures have distinct historical experiences with English, leading to different levels of cultural penetration (e.g. in popular culture) and depth of function (e.g. in business and law). The second section looks at different examples to explore their specific cultural engagements with the English language, but also to identify what they have in common: Japan English and Singlish develop in very different cultures, but the course with emphasis comparison as well as contrast."
"This course is developed to introduce key concepts in learning English as a second language (L2) from a range of theoretical perspectives such as linguistic approach (e.g., universal grammar), interactionist approach (e.g., the Interaction hypothesis), frequency-based approach (e.g., connectionism) and sociocultural approach (e.g., constructivism). In addition, this course reviews the role of individual differences in L2 English learning such as learners’ first language, the onset age of L2 English learning, language learning aptitude, and motivation. This course aims to lead students to understand the relationship between theory and research, and thereby generate pedagogical implications to English education in the Chinese/Asian contexts."
"This course serves as a general introduction to the field of sociolinguistics – the study of the relationship between language and society. Students will be introduced to basic theories, research methods, and analytical tools in sociolinguistics. They will also be given opportunities to investigate the link between language practices and social factors (e.g., ethnicity, gender, and class). Topics covered in this course include code-switching, language variation and change, language in the media, styles, identity, language attitudes, as well as language policy. Examples will be drawn from a wide range of social contexts, with a focus on the English language. Sociolinguistic topics in Hong Kong are given particular consideration."
"This course will complement ENGE1610 in introducing students to the study of literature. It focuses on short stories, poems, plays and other kinds of writing from a variety of countries. It is designed to illustrate something of the variety, range and richness of writing currently being done in English around the world. Many of the texts chosen will be those exploring aspects of cross-cultural, multilingual or post-colonial experience, in which students may find resonances with their own experience in contemporary Hong Kong. Students will be introduced to some relevant analytical approaches and theories on which later courses in the major will build."
"This course introduces students to some landmarks in the history of literature in English from the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries. Students will read at least one play by Shakespeare, become familiar with such genres as lyric poetry and drama, and consider the literature of the period in relation to corresponding developments in politics and religion, and to other arts and sciences. Special attention will be given to the rise of Western modernity, as reflected in the texts studied."
"This course follows on from Drama in Performance I and will follow a similar pattern: students will study short plays and excerpts from longer plays, workshop them in small groups, with the aim of performing pieces of similar length before an audience at the end of the course. The two plays selected for Drama in Performance II have been deliberately chosen to reflect non-realist, non-naturalistic traditions in Western Theatre. By the end of the course, students would have learned how to stage abstract theatre, paying particular attention to physical movement and the delivery of poetry."
"This course aims to help students enhance their communication with people who have a different language and cultural background. Topics include the concept of culture; language and cultural socialization; cultural variations in verbal and nonverbal communication; language, identity and biases; cultural diversity in perception, values, and worldview; intercultural-intimate relationships; culture shock and intercultural adjustment/adaptation; intercultural conflict and mediation; and English in the global workplace. This course should be of interest to local and international students, and is especially appropriate for those who plan to travel, study, or work abroad."
"The aim of this course is to equip students with the grammatical knowledge that is essential for ESL teaching and learning. The first part of the course introduces students to key concepts involved in grammar pedagogy and teaching methodologies. The second part of the course covers grammatical forms and structures in English that may be particularly difficult for second language learners to acquire, with an emphasis on understanding the connection between form and meaning. Students apply what they have learned through conducting mini-lessons and team-teaching. At the end of the course, students should feel more confident about the use of grammar terminology in second language teaching and more knowledgeable about a task-based and discourse-oriented approach to grammar teaching in second language classrooms."
"This course focuses on how language is used to communicate meanings in context. The course covers the semantic principles of the meanings of words and sentences, integrated within the framework of the study of the communicative uses of language, as well as the pragmatic principles underlying linguistic communication. Among the major topics introduced are implicature, presupposition, speech acts, and politeness."
"This course introduces students to lexicology, the branch of linguistics concerned with the study of the vocabulary of a given language. Focusing on but not limited to English, this course aims at developing students’ sensitivity to the English lexicon and enabling them to apply linguistic principles in morphology, syntax, and semantics to the systematic description of English words. The course covers the notion of word meaning, the various lexical relations among words, the historical origin and development of the English vocabulary, the major word-formation processes in English, the nature and pervasiveness of figurative language, and ways English words are used in particular contexts."
"The students spend two weeks in the U.K. attending plays, visiting sites relevant to their study of English literature, as well as museums and art galleries. The aim is to enrich and broaden the students’ linguistic and cultural understanding. The impact of the study tour will be optimized by thorough preparation, a policy of English usage during the study tour and a series of writing tasks focused on the plays attended and cultural sites visited, including a reflective Tour Journal, all of which will be assessed on their return. Pre-departure discussions will prepare the students for every aspect of the tour."
"Students will be selected by a panel of senior staff based on achievement in relevant Department courses and willingness and likely capacity to benefit. Classes will be divided in two strands: ""Literature, Linguistics and Society""; ""Current Affairs: Britain and the World"". Oxford tutors will conduct 4 hours' face-to-face teaching a day for 5 days a week. Students will spend some evenings and weekend days in excursions to London and Stratford for plays and other cultural sites. Fieldwork and cultural explorations will be closely supervised by College nominees and/or Department staff. Full reflective essays and diary-plus-video are required of all participants for presentation within CUHK at their own college presentation evenings, and to other English Department majors at university orientation events. Each student on return will be expected to volunteer for either a teaching role for underprivileged students or one of CUHK's ICARE service projects (Possibility of financial contribution being waived for needier candidates). Classes will take place in St Hilda's College Oxford for 3 weeks during the summer term, between second and third years."
"This course examines the field of comparative literature through a variety of readings in English and Chinese. It aims to introduce students to the main theories and methodologies of comparative literature and offers practical exercises in the application of these various approaches. After a preliminary discussion of the definition and scope of the field, other areas touched upon are: influence/reception studies; period/movement studies; genre/style studies; thematology/myth studies; interdisciplinary studies (e.g., literature and the other arts, literature and psychology, literature and linguistics, literature and literary theory)."
"The aim of the course is to strengthen students’ writing and speaking skills for a wide range of communicative contexts. Students will take advantage of different writing tasks to polish their descriptive, narrative and analytical writing skills. They will also learn to appreciate and apply different tones and styles for different workplace writing purposes.  Through working on a feature report, students will also become more competent in research, analysis and the organization and presentation of ideas. In addition, students are encouraged to capitalize on the small-class environment by taking a proactive role in class discussions and presentations. The job interview and panel discussion exercises also provide students with opportunities to enhance their oral skills. It is hoped that by the end of the course, students can become competent and confident users of English across a variety of contexts."
"This course will address itself to the origin of Romanticism, its development and application as a conceptual model; it will involve the study of romantic poetry in the English tradition, with reference to some major themes such as nature, time, love and death."
"This course introduces students to Modernism as a literary and historical movement which attempted to redefine the major concepts of art, the role of artist and the value of aesthetics as offered and established by tradition. Emphasis will be put on the historical factors and implications of this significant cultural change from tradition to modernity. Works to be discussed may be drawn from poetry, drama, fiction, as well as other creative and critical forms of discourse."
"This course is an introduction to literary stylistics, which, to put it at its simplest, is the application of linguistics to the study of literature. Its aim is to give some sense of the distinctiveness of literary uses of language in both poetry and prose. Non-literary as well as literary stylistics are studied so that an awareness of both the continuities and discontinuities between literary and nonliterary uses of language can be developed. The main theme of this course is that, while literature cannot be defined in terms of any distinctive language patterns, the study of language patterns that are central to or typical of it can give real insight into its nature."
"From year to year the readings and the themes emphasized in this course will vary. Among the themes that enter more or less prominently into varying interpretations of American literature are egalitarianism, democracy, egotism, restlessness, regionalism, humour, lawlessness, hostility to traditional forms and ways of doing things, homoeroticism, and (especially in the twentieth century) the city, materialism, and the perils of the machine. Nineteenth-century writers who may be represented include Hawthorne, Poe, Emerson, Thoreau, Whitman, Melville, Dickinson, Twain and James. Twentieth-century writers who may be represented include Cather, Frost, Anderson, Stevens, William Carlos Williams, Pound, Ransom, Cummings, Fitzgerald, Faulkner, Hemingway, Tennessee Williams, Miller, Mailer, Updike, Robert Lowell and Sylvia Plath."
"This course introduces students to some seminal European texts of the nineteenth century. Topics for discussion include: a) realism (e.g., Balzac, Flaubert, Turgenev, Shaw) as an aesthetic form capable of reflecting society and its concerns; b) symbolist poetry (e.g., Baudelaire, Poe, Mallarmé, Yeats) as an important source for Anglo-American modernism; c) other major writers' works expressing some of the major issues of the century (e.g., Dickens, Dostoievsky, Nietzsche, Tolstoy, Georges Sand, George Eliot, Thomas Hardy)."
"This course invites students to cross cultures by comparing or contrasting certain themes as they are expressed in major representative works of the West and the East. Its starting point will be the Middle Ages in Europe and the Tang Dynasty in China, leading into the twentieth century. Some attention will also be given to India and Japan. Among the themes considered will be the transcendent and the immanent, fate and free will, death and rebirth, reward and punishment, faith and reason, revolution and reformation, classicism and romanticism, capitalism and communism, male and female, war and peace."
"This course investigates the basic concepts and issues relevant to a critical understanding of the relationship between literature and culture in the context of socio-historical changes. Selected literary works will be read as the expression of cultural problems and cultural analysis attempted in the light of its broader implications for literary interpretation. While the specific topic may vary from year to year, some typical examples are: popular culture, postmodern culture, third-world culture, revolutionary culture, culture and resistance and comparative culture."
"This course may range from a concentrated study of specific topics to considerations of general principles in aesthetics/philosophy. Under this course heading, various inter-disciplinary or comparative studies of literature and other subjects can be offered, for example, literature and painting/sculpture, literature and architecture, literature and music, and others."
"This course will approach the relations between literature and religion with regard to both “form” and “content”. Its first part will concentrate on overall questions about the nature of language patterns and uses in both religious and literary contexts. There are a number of very striking similarities here, and we will ask what these say about the nature of both religion and literature. This course’s second and final parts will concentrate on insights about religious and literary forms of language and their uses to the study of particular literary, and to some extent religious, texts. The religious dimension of the course will relate mainly to Judaeo-Christian forms of religion, but attention will also be given to other, particularly of course Chinese, forms of religion."
"(UGED3143 is double-coded with ENGE3220.) The aim of this course is to familiarize students with the kindred relationships between film and literature as well as their essential mediumistic differences such as film and the novel, film and drama/theatre, film and poetry, etc. Their similar or different uses of time and space, and problems of adaptation will be discussed in some works which have both filmic and literary versions."
"This course explores critically the relationship between gender and literature in specific sociocultural contexts. Some basic arguments in the feminist perspectives on literary study will be introduced and selected works by both male and female writers discussed. While topics may vary from year to year, some typical examples are: the representation of woman,gender identity and difference, literature and desire, sexuality and imagination, and writing under patriarchy."
"This course aims to introduce students to the study of writers working in English but with a different cultural or linguistic background. Works and authors studied will vary from year to year. Offerings with different subtitles can be taken up for credit, up to a maximum of two times."
"This course aims at stimulating the students’ imagination while at the same time improving their writing skills. Students will have a large measure of freedom in their approach to numerous short assignments, but will be encouraged to experiment and write in a wide variety of genres and styles."
"Education is one of the major ways in which a society imparts knowledge and skills on, and develops the characters and potentials of, its citizens, and the teacher is a key figure in this process. In this course, we will explore the topic of education and representations of the teacher in literature by focusing on fiction and drama from various historical and cultural contexts. The course will examine issues which are both socio-cultural and literary, and which will include: the impact of education and teachers on individual development and growth as represented in the texts; the ideological implications of education and teachers; and a comparison between the ways education is valued in the East and the West. It will also analyze the socio-historical contexts behind the works, in order to understand how these helped shape the portrayals of education and teachers in them. Some of the questions the course will tackle are: What does education have to do with literature? How does the representation of education and the teacher figure vary across writers, time, place and culture? What are some of the assumptions behind and implications of these different portrayals? And what relevance does thinking about education and the teacher in literature have on literature students?"
"This course aims first to introduce students to autobiography, one of the most popular forms of writing in the contemporary world. It will raise such questions as, why has this kind of narrative been so attractive to writers in cross-cultural situations, such as Chinese-Americans? The course will focus specifically on a group of (mainly American) immigrant autobiographers who write about the experience of living between a first language and English. They raise a range of fascinating questions about language and identity. Students will be asked to reflect on these questions and on the similarities and differences between these writers’ lives and their own experience in Hong Kong. The course will aim to teach students how to approach, analyse and theorize about autobiographical narratives. Students will be given opportunity to develop their analytical skills in essay-type responses to the prescribed texts. They will also be given opportunity to develop their narrative skills in their own life-writing, using the prescribed texts as models. Both forms of written exercise are designed to extend, as well as test, students’ understanding of autobiography as a genre."
This course follows ENGE3260 but is not dependent on it. It provides an introduction to the craft of writing short stories. Students will read and analyse a range of short stories of diverse styles and forms from the beginnings of the genre to the present day. Particular attention will be given to contemporary stories written in Hong Kong. Students will be encouraged to use these texts as models for their own creative responses. The course aims both to deepen and broaden students’ understanding of the short story genre as well as to offer them the opportunity of gaining practical expertise in creative writing.
"This course is a play-writing seminar and workshop and aims to deepen students’ understanding of drama as well as giving them practical experience in creating original theatrical works. In a seminar setting, the class will read and analyse some works of modern English-language playwrights, as well as practise various styles and genres of drama during in-class writing exercises. The students will engage in intensive reading and critique of one another’s work and spend time writing and rewriting independent assignments such as dialogues, monologues, and scenes, culminating in the creation of a one-act play that will be performed in either a staged production or dramatic reading at the end of the term."
"This course is a film-writing seminar and workshop, which gives students both theoretical understanding of how films (both feature and short) work and practical experience in creating original short screenplays, as well as a grounding for longer works. The class will read film screenplays, as well as analysis of film and the screenwriting process. Students will also watch and analyse short films, scenes from longer works, and entire feature films (which will be screened outside of class hours). They will practise various elements of the film-writing process and engage in intensive reading and critique of one another's work. Besides weekly short writing assignments, the students will work on two short film screenplays—one an adaptation of a literary work and the other a completely original piece. Each student will then produce, or participate in the production of, one of these film scripts as a short video."
"Students will study Hong Kong literature in English in its colonial and postcolonial contexts. Works from different genres will be discussed to explore the following issues: the representation of Hong Kong and its people, the question of identity, the agency of its people, the impact of modernity and postmodernity, and the ideas of home and exile. Students’ analytical and critical skills will be sharpened to enhance their understanding of literary works, their awareness of the dynamic interrelationships between literature and social-political forces, and their appreciation of the meeting points between Hong Kong literature in English and Hong Kong literature in Chinese."
"The course introduces students to English literature written in the Victorian period. Students will read and analyze Victorian literature drawn from the beginning to the end of the period, and from a range of different genres. Among the themes which may be investigated are religion, identity, propriety, morality, social class, reform, and gender. The course will also explore the relationships between literary themes and methods across these decades, and changing historical contexts and social issues. Time permitting, comparisons may also be drawn between such literary works and their visual representations, whether in film or art."
"This course will cover key texts that deal with the relationship between literature and political theory. The course examines how major writers have dealt with such topics as nationalism, self-determination, political independence, totalitarianism, terrorism and animal rights. The course will introduce students to the political and historical context of each piece of writing and then examine the text in light of the relevant political theory. It will examine how political ideologies such as Marxism, socialism and conservatism have been important as motivating factors both for artists and critics. The course will examine political writings from a range of genres and from a range of literary periods."
"This course is designed to investigate topics in creative writing not normally covered under generic creative writing courses. It may involve any one or more of the following areas in creative writing studies: literary community and global citizenship, writing for new media, creative writing and other arts, creative writing and social enterprises, phenomenology and creative writing, creative writing and research, writing speculative fiction, writing flash fiction, teaching creative writing, history of creative writing, and the writing of auto-ethnography. Students are allowed to take the above course more than once and gain the units each time they pass the course. However, students cannot take courses with the same course code more than once in a single term."
"This course focuses on the art of writing about Hong Kong. Through the use of writing prompts, it introduces students to the different ways of writing about different social and physical environments in Hong Kong. Students will be able to discuss and articulate the feelings, thoughts and experiences evoked by these social and physical environments. They will be able to produce writings that evoke the sense of place that is unique to Hong Kong. They will be able to consider issues such as genre, gender and language use in relation to readership. Through active participation in class discussion and exploration of actual environments, students will acquire different perspectives and understand the diverse possibilities in relation to writing about Hong Kong. They will be able to assess their own writing and those of others."
"This course introduces students to a selection of new writing from the African continent. It does so in order to demonstrate the diversity of writing emerging from the multiple and diverse contexts present in the continent. Although primarily interested in writing in English, this course may also explore works in translation to bring into sharp relief the heterogeneous and variegated nature of the contemporary African novel. The focus on contemporary writing from the continent (read as works published within the last 10 years) means that writers other than those typically studied on such courses are to be read. The emphasis here is on the introduction of new writers to students, and the socio-historical contexts in which they write. To this end, students will enrich their understanding of world literature. Although not required, those who have taken ENGE3250 “Other Literature in English – An Introduction to African Literature” prior to this course will be in an advantageous position."
"This course examines the various ways in which London has been represented in a selection of diverse contemporary novels. Through both the close-reading of specific passages from the set novels and a general engagement with secondary theoretical material, it will become clear that the city continues to be represented in many different ways. From this observation emerges the realization that London is in fact, and has always been, an assemblage of very different Londons. It is this important observation that leads to the key conclusion of the course – no act of representation can ever fully capture its object of enquiry and, because of this, what has been chosen to be represented is always the product of a political decision."
"For the last one hundred years or so, the respected literary critic was one who conducted a patient, private, close reading of an inevitably small number of texts. Today, due to the rampant digitization of hundreds of thousands of texts and radical developments in the accessibility of statistical analysis packages and platforms, the literary critic has been emancipated from working in only this way. This course introduces you to the field of computational literary analysis, which is to say a new way of engaging literary texts that takes advantage of such developments. By way of practice-based learning, you will learn to use the basic functionality of R – the leading language and platform for statistical computing and graphics in the humanities – in order to ask very different questions of literature to those that you typically learn to ask on an English literature programme. Importantly, the answers that you receive to such novel questions might just surprise you..."
"This course will study literature that represents visual arts or, ekphrasis. The term ‘ekphrasis’ can be broadly defined as verbal representation of visual arts and has become a vibrant field of study for a few decades. We will look at some most famous ekphrastic texts from the beginning of Western literature to this day, focusing on poems evoking either actual or imaginary artworks, but branching out to ekphrasis in fiction and new media as well. In the process, we will reflect on the evolution of the term ‘ekphrasis’ from a rhetorical device to a site of rivalry and on to a mode of encounter between the verbal and visual medium. The course will explore interactions of multiple media while foregrounding characteristics of each medium."
"This course introduces students to the history and methods of documentary poetry, focusing on both critical appreciation and creative practice, and offering opportunities to conduct their own practice-based creative research. Documentary poems represent a public event or historical moment by incorporating news accounts, photographs, legal records, or other archival materials into poetic writing. In this course, we’ll explore why documentary poetry is increasingly popular among contemporary poets who seek to make an impact in public conversations. The course traces the ways contemporary poets build on the tradition of documentary poetry, and asks how documentary practices are changing as public and private archives become more available through digitization. In order to explore new approaches to generating creative work ourselves, the course alternates several practicum-style skills workshops with writing workshops and seminar-style discussions of assigned readings. Over the course of the term, we’ll combine poetry-writing, visual arts, and literary journalism approaches with archival research and digital humanities skills, making our own original documentary poetic projects using compositional tools ranging from scissors and tape, to digital image manipulation software, to computational poetry programs. Previous experience with the course tools is not required; the only prerequisite is an interest in language, history, and how we remember our world together."
"This course introduces students to the playwright William Shakespeare. By reading a number of Shakespeare's plays, drawn from the genres of comedy, history, tragedy and romance, students will achieve an understanding of Shakespeare's language, his modes of characterization, his methods of creating dramatic situations, and his representative themes. Students will also study the relationship of Shakespeare's scripts to their original Elizabethan and Jacobean performance contexts. Time permitting, attention will also be given to the performance history of Shakespearean drama and the continuing importance of that drama in twentieth-first century world theatre."
"This course looks at how comparisons can be made between languages with respect to their sound systems, lexical-semantic structures, sentence patterns, and pragmatic properties. Through systematic analysis, students gain understanding from research findings in language typology, language universals, and language acquisition. This course focuses on the basic characteristics of English and Chinese, and some salient contrasts between them. The approach is largely descriptive without assuming prior knowledge of theoretical syntax. The course also considers how comparisons between languages may help students associated with problems of translation and language teaching/learning."
"This course introduces psycholinguistics as it relates to language processing, acquisition, and development. We survey a range of topics such as language and the brain; real-time language processing and associated neuroimaging research; learning and memory; learner characteristics, age effects, and the critical period hypothesis; bi- and multi-lingualism; abnormal language development, language breakdown, and dyslexia; animal communication systems; which in turn shed light on mechanisms supporting human language and cognition."
"This course presents insights from cognitive linguistics and their potential relevance to second and foreign language teaching. The course addresses core concepts in this area of study including: prototype, perspective, categorization, image schema, figure and ground, metaphor, metonymy, entrenchment, embodied cognition, construction grammar, etc. The course discusses how cognitive linguists design pedagogical methods and stimulate learners to explore the deeper meanings of language forms."
"The aims of this course are to help students,• Have robust understanding about how instruction can facilitate second language acquisition; • Understand input-based and out-based approaches to second language teaching;• Learn pedagogical approaches to L2 grammar and vocabulary development; • Apply theories into second language teaching revolving around the four language skills (i.e., listening, speaking, reading, and writing); and• Discuss how to utilize technology in language classrooms and how to evaluate L2 development. The course will show how theory informs practice (for activities, tasks, and lesson plans), make use of experiential learning (in order to help foster a dual perspective – student and teacher), and require regular reflection on teaching."
"This course introduces some major approaches as well as basic principles and tools in the analysis of texts. Concepts such as cohesion and coherence, relevance, context, and identity are drawn upon to analyze a range of discourses and text types in our contemporary society. Texts to be discussed include advertisements, news reports, interviews, political speeches, websites, book reviews, etc. The relevance of discourse analysis to foreign/second language teaching may also be considered."
"This course presents an overview of the origins and development of the English language from its earliest beginnings to the present day. The development of the language through its different stages is outlined: Old English, Middle English, Early Modern English, Present Day English. The influence of the social and historical background is exemplified throughout the course. The positive values of English as an international language are compared with the dangers of linguistic and cultural imperialism."
"This course provides an introduction to the relationship between gender and language use. Drawing from empirical and theoretical studies in sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, and discourse analysis, this course addresses a range of issues. Examples of key issues include the acquisition of gender-differentiated language, gender and conversational interaction (e.g. extralinguistic constructions of gender or politeness, hedging or interruptions), sexism in language, gender images, and the relationships among language, gender, and other social constructs such as class, culture, and ethnicity."
"This web-enhanced course is designed for students in all Faculties with recent or current international experience (study abroad, international exchange, volunteering, service-learning, internships, educational travel, work or residence abroad). In relation to their own (and others’) international experience, students explore such topics as language/culture shock, intercultural adjustment, reentry, identity expansion, intercultural/global citizenship, and intercultural competence in a second language. Through critical reflection, reading, discussion, and writing, students develop a deeper understanding of their international experience and discover ways to incorporate it into their CUHK life and post-graduation plans."
"There are two constant properties of language: variation and change. Languages vary in form across geographic space and social groups, and linguistic forms evolve over time, adapting to the society in which they are embedded. It makes sense to study these together because of their intricate links: if a language undergoes different transformations in different areas or subgroups, then variation results. As such, studying language change can help us to understand variation, and the nature of linguistic variation provides evidence as to how language changes. The course will focus on variation and change as a window to understanding the nature of language. It will cover topics related to these two properties such as language attitudes, historical change, and language contact. A sizeable number of case studies will be drawn from English. To strengthen the links between theoretical knowledge and practice, students will work hands-on with sociolinguistic data and attempt to analyze them using the framework of language variation and change."
"The rise of English as a global language lights the fuse for bilingualism (and multilingualism). This course aims to introduce theories and research findings concerning bilingualism and related phenomena. Bilingualism is both individual and societal. The first half of the course focuses on bilingual development within individuals. Topics include bilingual language development, factors affecting bilingual acquisition, bilingualism and aging, and cognitive advantages conferred by being bilinguals. The second half of the course turns to societal bilingualism. It will examine issues concerning language use, policymaking, and bi/multilingual education in different regions around the world, including but are not limited to Canada, Sweden, Singapore, and Hong Kong. This course will be of interests to students who are keen on linguistics and literacy development, language education, cognitive science, and developmental psychology."
"This course provides an undergraduate-level overview of research methods within the field of applied linguistics. It provides students with vital skills necessary for designing, conducting, and evaluating research projects centered on language use and communication in real-world contexts, in anticipation of research endeavors like their final year or capstone projects. Participants will be introduced to research paradigms and principles tailored to applied linguistics, in addition to various research methodologies. These encompass quantitative methods like experiments and corpus-based studies, as well as qualitative approaches such as case studies and ethnographic research. The course places a particular emphasis on the practical application of these methods within the realm of applied (English) linguistics.The course delves into an extensive array of data collection techniques commonly employed in applied linguistics research, including surveys, narrative studies, ethnographic observations, and corpus analysis. Through class activities, students will develop the skills needed to select the most suitable methods for their research questions, construct data collection instruments, and efficiently manage and analyze data sets. The course covers data analysis techniques encompassing both quantitative and qualitative methods. Students will have the opportunity to analyze quantitative data using statistical software and interpret the results, as well as to develop skills in the analysis of qualitative data, employing methods like thematic analysis and critical analysis. Several hands-on activities will be provided to encourage students to actively interact with and better grasp the concepts."
"This course is designed to help undergraduate students understand the underlying processes involved in reading in English as a second language. The course will begin with fundamental theories on cognitive processes of first and second language reading, such as process models and component models. The course then reviews various components of second language reading, such as working memory, background knowledge (schema), and L2 linguistic knowledge (vocabulary and grammar). In addition, this course will invite students to discuss how to better utilize English reading to promote the development of English proficiency, with particular attention to tasks and technology use."
"This course examines the first and second language acquisition of English phonetics and phonology, with a focus on various linguistic and extralinguistic processes and factors that impact acquisition. The impact of social factors such as identity and peer group networks on acquisition and use of different phonological features is also discussed. The course also examines accent and intelligibility, specifically in relation to stereotyping in the media. The course concludes with a discussion of the phonological features of the English spoken in Hong Kong."
"This objective of this course is to (a) provide an overview of a variety of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, (b) enable students to evaluate AI technologies, and (c) facilitate students to apply AI technologies to identify key problems in their major field (e.g., business, education, philosophy, social science) and/or explore potential solutions for those problems. It incorporates a hybrid approach combining lecture segments and hands-on activities so that students are able to have a better understanding of what AI is and how AI technologies have been used for diverse purposes. The first part of the course focuses on exploring a variety of applications (and programming codes in Python) for image creation, text mining, web crawling, modelling, speech recognition, conversation, etc. In the second part, students work on developing a website where they introduce and discuss the problems and solutions of their interest, which are explored using AI technologies."
"Recognizing how technology has dramatically revolutionized not only the way we learn but also the way we work, communicate and interact with one another, this course examines diverse digital literacies that have become critical for agentive participation in the new social order. As people move fluidly across digitally-mediated spaces, how they negotiate their linguistic and semiotic resources shapes the way they construct their identities, acquire knowledge, and expand their social networks. Drawing on New Literacy Studies, this course demonstrates how digital literacy is not a neutral, technical competence, and that digital practices develop within broader social, political, and cultural contexts. Online spaces are circumscribed by competing and colluding ideologies, shaping new forms of inequality and social fragmentation. To respond to these issues, this course discusses the need to develop both functional and critical digital literacies to navigate and transform an increasingly technologized world."
"What happens to language when it goes online? Is the internet bad for the English language? Is online communication changing our relationships with others? Will emoji become a new language? This course examines the relationship between language and the internet. It explores how people use language on the internet as well as how new technologies are changing the ways we write and communicate. Internet platforms covered in this course include “traditional” ones such as email and discussion forums, and recent social media such as Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube. Key research methods and theories of the emerging area of Internet Linguistics are also discussed. The course concludes by looking into the future of the English language on the increasingly globalized and multilingual internet."
"The power of data is recognizable – now more than ever. Data has always existed and now has taken center stage in the world and its industries, especially in recent years. In this course, you will learn how to leverage your data, that is, learn how to transform it into something meaningful and useful for scientific research. Building on your prior knowledge of digital literacy, statistics, and programming, we will delve deeper into contemporary topics and approaches in Data Science and statistics as it relates to the English language. Unlike other data science and statistics courses, this course is designed for students who have already the foundations of data science but hope to specialize in, conduct research on, or create projects related to the English language and linguistics. Following a topical approach, we will explore more advanced topics in data management, processing, statistics, and data visualization using the programming tool R, covering trending topics like dimensionality reduction, natural language processing, and machine learning and how these are applied to the study of English. You will gain a contextualized understanding of statistics and practical skills for tackling core data scientific challenges relevant to the field."
"The study of the intersection between language, text, and computation is a rapidly developing field with broad applicability throughout the social sciences and the humanities. Being able to analyze linguistic and textual data is a highly useful skill for in academic work, in the private sector, and government-related work. The course intends to build on your prior knowledge of digital literacy, statistics, and programming and delves deeper into contemporary topics in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and data science as it relates to linguistics and the social sciences (e.g., anthropology, history, psychology, and sociology). It is designed for students who hope to explore language data using NLP techniques. Students will get first-hand experience working with state-of-the-art software in corpus linguistics, NLP, and data science (i.e., Python, CasualConc). They will learn contextualized techniques to parse and collate information from text-rich documents, such as corpora as well as social media. This course assumes that students have a rudimentary knowledge of Python, linguistics, and data analysis."
"An intensive study of the life, the imaginative character, and the works of a single author or authors who have played major roles in the development of Western literature. Authors studied may vary from year to year. Offerings with different subtitles can be taken up for credit, up to a maximum of two times."
"This course aims to cover some of the key poetic texts of the English Renaissance in order to explore two of their ongoing preoccupations: love and death. This course will explore the ways these texts use two aspects of the human experience to consider the nature of what lies beyond the human: the ideal, the metaphysical, and God. Where the love poetry of the period frequently idealizes the beloved into a kind of a divinity, Renaissance poetry which ruminates on the nature of mortality frequently does so under the eyes of a God who is, by turns, vengeful and merciful, benevolent and indifferent. While this course is thematic, it also covers many of the formal preoccupations of English Renaissance poetry. Some of these include: imitation, pastoral, paradox, metaphor, and epic form. Poems by Spenser, Sidney, Shakespeare, Donne, Herbert, and Milton will be covered. These are some of the most important figures in English literature, but whose language and chronological distance make them daunting to many students. This course will not only make them more accessible, but it will teach students methods of close reading which will give them the skills to read other such difficult texts in the future."
"This course focuses on a single, seminal work of English literature: Milton’s Paradise Lost. The length and complexity of the work make it ideally suited for the kind of focused consideration that this course would provide. Some of the themes covered will be: the idea of literary imitation; the poet as prophet; the nature of sin; how to write about the ineffable; the power of persuasive language. These themes (and many more) are central to Paradise Lost, but are equally the concern of other texts by Milton as well as other writers in the period. Where possible, these additional works will be considered in order to shed light on Paradise Lost and to flesh out its complexities. Paradise Lost has also been the subject of a wide variety of literary critical approaches – reader response, new historicist, psychoanalytic – and these too will be considered over the duration of the course. There will also be a significant emphasis placed on reading aloud in this course. Typically, a lecture will contain an hour of literary analysis from me followed 45 minutes of reading aloud performed by me and the students. Students will be allocated characters in the poem to read in preparation for each lecture."
"This course will acquaint students with a number of basic concepts of theoretical positions in literary criticism by reading and analysing certain seminal texts taken from the modern age. Specific topics of investigation include: (a) language and structure; (b) meaning and interpretation; and (c) text and context. Discussion of these topics will lead to a greater understanding of the primary features, strategies and implications of the main currents in contemporary critical theory such as structuralism/semiotics, reader response, hermeneutics, psychoanalysis, feminism and socio-cultural criticism."
"This course will investigate some critical concepts and literary theories within the context of East/West comparative literature. In this special context the advantages, problems and validity of applying Western theoretical models to Chinese literature such as romanticism, tragedy, comedy and bildungsroman will be considered."
"This course will focus on one seminal work of Western literature: Dante’s Inferno. The length and richness of this work make it ideally suited for the focussed, semester-long consideration this course will provide. Some of the themes covered will be: the concept of Hell, the nature of Sin, the poet as prophet, the medieval understanding of the cosmos, the uses of allegory. These themes not only exist in the Inferno, but will be substantiated and extrapolated by references to many of Dante’s other works, including Vita Nuova, Monarchia, and the Convivio. These other works, together with details of Dante’s political life, biography, and historical period will be brought to bear on the text as we read through it. Emphasis will also be put on the various literary critical approaches which have been taken to the text, including historicist, feminist, and psychoanalytic. Students are encouraged to take ENGE4120 Reading Paradise Lost either before or after taking this course."
"This course is the Creative Writing Stream’s advanced writing workshop elective. In this course, you will hone your skills in a particular genre (poetry, fiction, life writing, or dramatic writing) by receiving sustained, detailed feedback from a workshop leader and your peers in a focused, intimate setting. Our small class size will allow us to study and practice the techniques of creative writing with a rigor and intensity impossible in a larger lecture course. You will practice drafting and revision strategies; learn to give and receive constructive feedback; and produce a substantial, revised, and well-polished portfolio of your creative writing. You will also learn professionalization skills including preparing your work both for publication and for further study in the field of creative writing. Our main texts will be each other’s writing, but we will also read and discuss craft essays and published creative works, and become familiar with the several main models of creative writing workshops, their histories, and the communities with which they are associated. You do not need to feel “advanced” in your writing to take this writing-intensive course, but you must have taken at least one course in the Department’s Creative Writing Stream, and you must submit a writing sample for pre-approval by the instructor."
"An intensive study of a major issue in literary studies. Topic(s) will be defined from year to year by the Department of English. Offerings with different subtitles can be taken up for credit, up to a maximum of two times."
"This course is offered to those students who are selected each year to represent the University in the Chinese Universities Shakespeare Festival. As such, it will be highly selective: only five students will be invited to sign up. Of these students, three will be actors, and two will be assistant directors. All undergraduates in the department will be invited to audition in mid November.By the end of this course, students would have learned the fundamentals of Shakespearean stagecraft, voice production, creating a character, and expressive movement and gesture. They would also have learned the basic principles of technical aspects of production such as set, lighting, and costume design. Students will also have gained intimate knowledge of at least 3 Shakespearean plays which will be studied from both a literary critical and dramaturgical perspective.Students will also have to submit an analytical essay which asks them to utilise what they have learned in the experience of putting on a play for production, and to reflect upon that process.Offerings with different subtitles can be taken up for credit, up to a maximum of two times."
"We are surrounded by language. The visibility of languages in the city tells the history, identity, and culture of the people and place. This interdisciplinary course engages students in using linguistic landscape as a framework to examine the role of displayed language in the construction of places, identities, and ideologies. Linguistic landscape studies linguistic, sociocultural, political, spatial, educational, and communicative meanings, among others, of the language displayed in place. In this course, students will explore languages used in multiple spaces such as street,shop/supermarket, hospital, MTR station, school/university, museum, and restaurant and analyze them from interdisciplinary perspectives, drawing on linguistic, sociological, anthropological, communication, spatial, political, and educational/pedagogical theories. The course focuses on engaging students in fieldwork to collect the images/photos of the language displayed in city spaces and analyze them in class by taking multiple theoretical perspectives. The topics of discussion include multilingualism, multimodality, identity, place, people, and policy in linguistic landscape."
"Educational Linguistics is the field of study that focuses on the application of linguistics in education. This course aims at engaging students in understanding and examining how knowledge about linguistics and language use can be applied to address various educational issues such as effective language teaching/learning and policy-making in diverse contexts. The major topics of the course include: linguistics in the classroom, multilingual/multiliteracy education, language awareness, translanguaging pedagogies, and language education policy. In addition, the course focuses on how linguistic, racial/ethnic, and cultural diversities can be understood and addressed in education. Students will read and discuss major theories, models, and activities to explore the application of linguistics in education in different world contexts, including Hong Kong."
"This course focuses on a contemporary approach to discourse analysis, Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), which investigates real language data from a social and ideological perspective. The course aims to provide students with the analytical toolkit for understanding ideologies and power relations in different discourse contexts. Major research methods of CDA are illustrated through a range of authentic spoken and written texts such as political speeches, classroom interaction, broadcast news reports, advertisements, and websites."

"This course focuses on some topic of interest that has not been discussed in other courses in the regular program. Topics to be introduced depend on the availability of expertise and are related to the form, use, or acquisition of the English language. Students are expected to develop an in-depth understanding of the topic through reading and discussion of related research, papers, and data analysis. Offerings with different subtitles can be taken up for credit, up to a maximum of two times."
"In this capstone course, English majors in their final year of studies will carry out independent research on a topic approved by the Department and supervised by a teacher. It may involve a major essay (15-20 pages) in literature or linguistics, or it may be interdisciplinary. It may also take the form of a project or creative work such as a collection of poetry or short stories. The major paper/project must include critical reflection on the research process, build on undergraduate learning in the major, and make connections with future studies/career plans. The proposal for this course must be submitted to the Department before the term begins. At the end of the semester, all students taking ENGE 4700 will give an oral presentation and be evaluated by a panel of teachers and peers. This is a required course for all four-year students who have joined the Department of English during or after the 2012-2013 academic year."
"This course provides a broad introduction to general linguistics and the fundamental properties of human language shared by all language systems. It includes a survey of phonological, morphological, syntactic, and semantic structures of language, thus enabling students to investigate established theoretical premise for the linguistic description of natural languages and describe general grammatical properties of language universals in the light of the theory established. This course also equips students with some analytical tools and techniques for linguistic analysis and provides practice in using these scientific ways to discover the organizing principles underlying a language."
"What are the consequences of a world in which AI-generated content, fake news, and social media have increasingly eroded the boundary between truth and falsity, and how do these consequences impact the study and understanding of literature, the imaginative medium par excellence? This course will explore these questions by examining the concept of fiction, how it is manifested in various genres and forms, and what role it plays for writers and readers in contemporary society. Tracing its historical development, we will investigate the concept of fiction as a crucial dimension across time in various communicative contexts, including but not limited to literary discourse. Through analyzing examples ranging from novels and storytelling to non-fictional genres, including autobiographical discourses, documentaries, social media, and political speeches, students will learn how to evaluate and appreciate dominant perspectives within fiction theory, including panfictionalism, similarism, separationism, speech act theory, and possible worlds semantics. Students interested in gaining the theoretical and analytical tools to understand the many uses of fiction, its roles, effects, and potential consequences in contemporary society are welcome to join the course."
"The course provides students with an opportunity to explore the foundational genres of literature – fiction, drama, and poetry -- at an advanced level.

Students will work with a supervisor on the project, which must be approved by the Graduate Panel."
"This course examines the political and social dimension of science fiction writing. It does so by interrogating the different forms of utopia and dystopia presented in a number of science fiction films and novels. The course begins by tracing the concept of utopia back to its early literary origins in order to reveal its deeply political nature. Following this, we begin to think about the different forms of utopia and dystopia presented in science fiction writing, and begin to develop an understanding of utopia and dystopia as the product of a distinct critique of contemporary society. To this end, the course critiques three main staging grounds of utopia in science fiction – society; time and space; and, the body."
"This course is an introduction to American Literature of the twentieth century. We will study a representative selection of novels, drama, film, and poetry, and discuss concepts such as nationalism/national identity, the frontier, the American Dream, democracy, gender and sexuality, race and ethnicity, and immigration. As we discover significant historical moments, artistic movements, and geographical locations in these texts, we will also trace the social, political, and cultural conditions from which they emerge. Figures studied will include (but are not limited to): F. Scott Fitzgerald, Langston Hughes, William Carlos Williams, Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, Lorraine Hansberry, Alfred Hitchcock, John Ford, Amiri Baraka, Allen Ginsberg, Toni Morrison, Tony Kushner, and Jhumpa Lahiri."
"In this course, we will examine various modernist fiction, essays and poetry in order to understand not only the formal and innovative aspects of modernism, but also some of the historical and material conditions which propelled the literary movement of modernism into being in the first place. We will consider such wide-ranging historical issues as imperialism, modernity, war, and female emancipation, and see how these helped shape both the form and content of modernist literature. The course will involve extremely close reading of the texts, with the goals to re-introduce students to terminology useful in literary analysis, and to teach methods to analyze and understand the formal and technical complexities of literary modernism."
"In the context of a world that was beginning to understand the power of “big data,” Franco Moretti introduced the notion of “distant reading” to the field of literary studies. A method of literary scholarship that embraced the technological explosion at the end of the twentieth century, Moretti’s distant reading looked to transcend a literary studies that he thought of as dominated by the “theological exercise” of close reading – which is to say the “very solemn treatment of very few texts taken very seriously.” Distant reading attempted (attempts) to make sense of thousands of texts at the same time. It asks questions that only a survey of tens of thousands of texts can answer – how does the thematic concern of western literature change over the decades… or over the centuries? And not just the thematic concern of the canonical literature we all know, but all western literature (or as much of it as we can recover today!) Such questions cannot be answered by the individual scholar but, as Moretti understood, they can be answered with the aid of computation. This course introduces you to the debates provoked by Moretti’s ideas and then moves on to show you how distant reading is practiced today. By way of workshop and project-based learning, you will be introduced to the statistical analysis platforms that computational literary studies scholars use today. You will then learn how to use this software in order to generate your own distant readings of a corpus of texts."
"The course will examine some linguistic, behavioural, and neural aspects of language and speech in an English-as-a-second/foreign-language (ESL/EFL) or English-related bilingual context. Selected issues in speech perception, language comprehension and language production as well as the intermediate stages that comprise the language of thought will be considered. Special attention will be given to some current, representative models of discourse comprehension and production and their relevance to second language teaching and learning."
"This course provides a survey of the relationship between social variables (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity, attitude, style, location, time, social status, power, politics, and network membership) and variations in language in use. Some key areas covered include language attitudes and choice, language maintenance and shift, code alternation, contact languages, standard and vernacular languages, language planning and policy, regional and social dialects, influences of age and gender on language in use, politeness theory, linguistic stereotyping, as well as culture and language. Sociolinguistic research methods are also introduced."
"The purpose of this course is to introduce definitions, theoretical issues, and empirical research on the topic of second language acquisition (SLA). To be more specific, the aims of this course are to help students 1) gain familiarity with key concepts in SLA research, as a basis for critically understanding and developing professional practices; 2) develop an awareness of and ability to critique and design empirical research on topics related to SLA; 3) build an expert and personally relevant understanding of theoretical and empirical issues in the field, including cognitive-interactionist and frequency-based perspectives of SLA and the roles of learner factors such as age, first language, and individual difference variables; 4) understand the relationship between theory, research, and classroom applications; and 5) achieve increased awareness of how a range of relevant research and research methods can be used for the development of their own teaching practices and research agenda in the Chinese/Asian contexts."
"This course examines the relationship between language and intercultural communication theory, research, and practice to better understand communication between culturally diverse people. It addresses core concepts in this interdisciplinary area of study including: conceptions of culture and multiculturalism; the relationship between language, culture, power, and context; English as the primary language of intercultural/ international communication; language and identity (re)construction; race and ethnicity; generalizations and stereotypes; values, assumptions, and worldviews; non-verbal and verbal communication; intercultural relationship development; language/ culture shock and intercultural adaptation; and intercultural communicative competence."
"A corpus (plural corpora) is body of written text and/or transcribed speech which can serve as a basis for linguistic analysis and description. This course explores the ways in which corpora can be used to study the frequency and distribution of linguistic items, as well as collocations, keywords, and register variation. Most of the lectures are followed by a practical session, during which students gain hands-on experience in using the corpora and software demonstrated and/or discussed in the lectures. The corpora used include the International Corpus of English (ICE), the British National Corpus (BNC), the Chinese Learner English Corpus (CLEC), and many others. Students will learn how to use standard text retrieval software, including WordSmith, ICECUP, and WMatrix. The course is heavily computer-oriented, but no programming skills are required."
"This course provides a thorough introduction to common NLP techniques, focusing on how computers analyze, comprehend, produce, and process language. It incorporates a hybrid approach combining lecture segments, presentations, and hands-on activities to discuss how we can make use of various applications and programming codes (in Python) to facilitate research in (applied) linguistics and education. The modules that will be covered in the course include: introduction to language and computers, introduction to Python, preprocessing text, optical character recognition, speech to text, web scraping, frequency and n-gram, vector semantics and embeddings, part‑of‑speech tagging, constituency parsing, and dependency parsing. Crucially, students are expected to critically think about innovative ways to apply NLP techniques in (applied) linguistics and/or education."
"This course examines the process of evaluation in second language learning. Evaluation refers to the systematic gathering of information for purposes of making value judgements about language learning programmes and the participants in these programmes. The methods of enquiry include observations, interviews, meetings, questionnaires, and testing. Public English proficiency examinations, both local and overseas, will be critically assessed. Key ideas in testing will be covered: validity and reliability; tests of global proficiency and of separate skills; particular problems with tests of listening and oral English; tests of communicative competence."

This course focuses on both the development of a second language sound system as well as how to teach second language pronunciation.
"This course provides an overview of the discipline of cognitive linguistics and its application in second language teaching. Cognitive linguists understand the language that we encounter every day as input from which we draw inferences about form-meaning relationships, typical patterns, and schemata. The course addresses core concepts in this area of study including: prototype, perspective, categorization, image schema, figure and ground, metaphor, metonymy, entrenchment, embodied cognition, gesture, construction grammar, attention and salience, and contingency learning. The course discusses how cognitive linguists design pedagogical methods and stimulate learners to explore the deeper meanings of grammatical forms."
"This project-monitoring course aims to develop students’ basic academic skills through an independent, individual research project in a chosen area of applied English linguistics, guided by a supervisor. Students will be assessed through an oral presentation and a final written report of no more than 15,000 words. Students who wish to enrol in the course should submit a 500-word proposal by the end of term 1 to seek prior approval from the MA in Applied English Linguistics programme team. The proposal should outline the research background, review key literature in the chosen topic, and describe the methodology adopted. Students should also have achieved a cumulative GPA of 3.3 or above in order to enrol in this course.Prerequisite: ENGE5540 Research Methods in Applied Linguistics, which must be taken within the same academic year as this course. (Note: This course may not be offered every year. In addition, the course will not be available for enrolment if ENGE5540 is not on offer in a particular year.)"
"Recognizing digital literacies as a social practice, this course highlights the differentiated, situated, and enculturated ways in which technology is used for diverse relational, informational, expressive, and recreational purposes. Beyond being a set of skills that support the needs of the knowledge economy, digital literacies are understood as practices that address new modes of productivity, representation, and sociality. Through the interplay of human and non-human interactants, technology has reshaped identities, communities, and relations of power, enabling social mobility, while also constructing new forms of inequality. By discussing current theory and research around digital literacies, this course illuminates how technology continues to transform the social landscape and examines the implications of these changes on language and literacy learning and the conceptualisation of 21st century competences."
"Language Policy and Planning (LPP) studies the linguistic, sociocultural, economic, educational, and socio-political dimensions of decisions about the use, role, and status of languages across spaces. As an interdisciplinary field, LPP investigates how and why institutions, communities, and individuals create, negotiate, and implement language policies. This course aims to engage students in understanding and analysing the theories, research practices, impacts, and implications of LPP across spaces such as school/university, family, workplace, and public places. The course engages students in critical analyses of how language policies shapes language learning, socialization, identities (e.g., race, ethnicity, and social class), ideologies and inequalities. The major topics to be covered in the course are: language ideology, language education policy (including English as a medium of instruction and multilingual education), family language policy (FLP), agency in language policy, and linguistic landscape. Students will read research-based texts and participate in discussions to examine language policies from diverse world contexts, including minority language contexts."
"Recognizing how second language acquisition (SLA) does not just involve cognitive, linguistic or psychological processes, this course examines how it is bound to and shaped by the social context in which these processes occur. By focusing on the social dimensions of L2 acquisition and learning, this course provides an overview of research strands such as Vygotskian sociocultural theory, language socialization, culture, identity, investment, and critical issues of race, ethnicity, gender, and social class. Because L2 acquisition and learning is mediated, embodied, situated and socially gated, multilingual learners continually negotiate their linguistic and semiotic resources as they navigate different contexts and perform diverse identities. By examining how the micro level of social activity is indexical of macrostructures of institutions, language policies, and cultural norms, language learning is ineluctably intertwined with issues of power, ideology, and inequality. This course weaves together these ideas into an integrative perspective of L2 acquisition that enables a critical understanding of real-world issues of language learning and teaching."
"This course is designed to help students have a firm grasp of the fundamental theories of second language reading and thereby equip improved research and teaching skills. It begins with a discussion on the nature of reading and the differences between reading in first vs second languages. Then, various models of reading comprehension will be reviewed, including process models (bottom-up, top-down, and interactive) and component models (background knowledge, grammar, vocabulary, etc.). This course then reviews cognitive aspects of reading such as readers’ working memory, the relationship between reading rate and reading comprehension, and the impact of L1 orthographic system on L2 reading. In addition, this course delves into the pedagogical aspects of second language reading, such as the use of graded readers based on readability indices, the relationship between second language reading and second language acquisition, and lastly, how to better utilize tasks and technology in teaching second language reading."
The course aims at providing the students with an orientation of critical and interpretive approaches required of graduate studies in literature in a cross-cultural context. Various literary and critical paradigms from Western and Chinese traditions will be reviewed with a discussion of the basic issues in interpretation theory and criticism. The course will also focus on the implications of recent orientations in social sciences and philosophy for literary studies. Students will be required to identify their own research interests and pursue text- based case studies on problems or topics in criticism and interpretive theory that are involved in the interdisciplinary studies of literature.
"The course serves as an introduction to the advanced study of literature from comparative perspectives. With a view to enhancing their ability in identifying problems and topics for research, students will be familiarized, through team-work instruction, with the basic techniques and methods of bibliographical research and textual criticism. This will involve the use of specific primary texts. Emphasis will be put on giving the students an overview of historical as well as current research in the field. The concept of comparative literature will be investigated along with the various cultural as well as literary issues particularly involved in the studies of literature in the Chinese-Western context. Traditional areas of research, such as influence and reception, themes and motifs, genres and forms, and interrelations of literature and art, will be reviewed in the light of recent literary and cultural theories. In this course students will have to read major literary and critical texts with regard to the various perspectives on comparative literature."
"Specific area(s) of investigation will be defined every year to cover one or more of the following aspects in the critical and comparative studies of literary genre: poetics, prosaics; dramatic theories; narrative theories; questions of form and structure; issues in theme and style; concepts of character and hero; problems of generic convention and institution; as well as other topics related to the study of particular genres or subgenres of poetry, drama and fiction. Emphasis will be put on the dialectic between theory and practice. Textual analysis will be treated in relation to the critical investigation of possible cultural and historical contexts. Subject to the approval of the Division Head, students are allowed to take the above course more than once and gain the units each time they pass the course. However, students cannot take courses with the same course code more than once in a single term."
