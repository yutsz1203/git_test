"This course explores the core areas of (inter)cultural studies.Topics such as media culture, consumer culture, theme parks, cityscapes, spectacle society, cyberculture and technoscience culture will be discussed. Again, emphasis will be given to Hong Kong culture as a basic reference point in its contact and interaction with other cultures."
"This course is interested in how modernity is defined by contradiction and plurality not simply within the same city but across disparate geographic locations and historical periods. Looking at the variances of urban modernity, we will examine how blueprints for modernist, global, creative, and smart cities are articulated within the greater Asia region. Such templates are often standardized, top-down visions for urban renewal, economic growth, and technological progress with contrasting degrees of triumphalism and failure. The focus on metropolitan areas and city clusters offers a way of thinking beyond (or beneath) the nation. Uncovering characteristic tropes in film and visual cultures of the city, we will explore how multiple modernities are produced, disseminated, consumed, and reproduced through different media ecologies such as cinema, photography, visual art, architecture, maps, comic books, video games, and social media. Embracing a more expansive definition, we will regard Asia as sprawling, archipelagic, and diverse, inclusive of the marginalized, diasporic populations of Southeast Asia.We will ask: How can the complex flows, processes, and rhythms of a modern metropolis be visualized? What social and economic changes prevail in the shift to modes of governmentality characteristic of the conditions of neoliberal capitalism, media convergence, and immaterial production? How do urban infrastructure and architecture manage the dynamisms and tensions of modern flows and rhythms to reshape work productivity, public order, and collective memory? How are the voices and rights of the burgeoning class of cosmopolitan consumers and transnational migrants delimited and excluded from the configuration and operation of the modern Asian city?"
"Images of the body represent systems of thought, aesthetics beauty and our identity. This course takes a comparative approach to theories of body and embodiment in the Western and the Chinese traditions. In this course we will ask: What is a body? How do we define and represent different bodies? In what ways do cultural values mold our perception of the body? How is the understanding of the body informed and transformed by scientific development? Throughout this course we will seek answers to these questions by focusing on the Western and the Chinese traditions from the cultural and the scientific perspectives. We will analyse some important themes of the subject by integrating a theoretical approach with art, photography, films, novels and short stories."
"Cinema is one of the most important forms of representations in contemporary culture, and in this course we study film and video from the perspective of cultural studies. The course is not aimed at teaching students basic skills of textual and image analysis, but we read cinema culturally and politically. We want to examine how the cultural forms of moving images carry meanings, and how it can and cannot be used as ideological apparatus. Through the studies of film and video we also trace the development of contemporary visual culture and examine how it defines (post)modern lives and experience. Studying through the history of moving images, this course provides students a general theoretical landscape to understand and criticize our contemporary mass representations. Our ultimate aim is to interrogate the boundaries and to locate new terrains between cinema studies and cultural studies."
"Travel has recently become a complex phenomenon of unprecedented proportions. Whereas people travel and bring themselves into contact with other peoples and other cultures, cultures themselves also travel to different places and societies. Through an interdisciplinary approach, this course provides a theoretical and historical framework to analyse and reflect upon the relationships between travel and culture with the concerns of globalization, consumption, people and places."
This course aims at enhancing consciousness of the variations among humans in their sexualities and more accepting of individuals with sexualities different than your own. To accomplish this we will examine a number of variations with a sympathetic perspective without regard to their acceptability within the current cultural perspectives of our society. Students are encouraged to examine their sexuality in both critical and sympathetic ways incorporating the insights gained in the course.
"This course explores the impact of the worldwide technoscience revolution of our era in the cultural context. We are in the midst of the fast developments of technology and science. As witness to this important moment, we have a vantage point to review the cultural impact of technology on social, economic, political development over the past two centuries. As there is now a surge of feminist studies of science and technology, special emphasis will be given to the interrelationship between gender and technoscience."
"This course looks at theatre as an intercultural transference, “a unique machinery for overcoming cultural differences and reaching out towards other cultures.” It examines plays and productions, original and in translation, from theoretical and practical, literary and theatrical perspectives. The concern is not only with how the text is translated but also how new meanings are created against a local cultural environment, such as Hong Kong. Students will attend some local and visiting productions in the theatre."
"The specific topics of this course vary from year to year. Generally, they can be genres, systems of representation, cultural forms, issues and/or theories related to the dynamic process of interactivity among cultures."
"Globalization has become a key term in the analysis of contemporary society and culture. This course will trace the development of the concept across different disciplines and theoretical paradigms, review socio-economic and cultural accounts of globalization, study artistic production, and examine counter-discourses and social movements against globalization. Throughout the course, we will interrogate the politics of representation around globalization, questioning specifi cally the grounds on which global claims are made; the categories, processes, and practices foregrounded and occluded; the voices privileged, heard and silenced; and the kinds of subjectivities and collective identities enabled and produced in globalization discourses."
"This course introduces students to the critical study of media theory and popular culture, and its socio-cultural impacts on everyday life, society and geopolitics. It emphasizes the study of history, production, genre, social reception and political effect of various kinds of cultural products such as advertisement, photography, comics, television and VCD technology, popular music and MTV, newspaper and printing culture, computer and internet. The course’s objective is to acquaint students with different methodologies in media theory, and encourage them to examine the media text from the perspectives of semiotics, ideological criticism, gender representation and cultural policy. We also focus on the analysis and evaluation of popular culture in relation to the formation of capitalism, the rise of mass media, the commercialization of culture, lifestyle and leisure in comparative perspective."
"This course dwells on various topics in the field of cultural identities, from its historical origin and theoretical ground in the West, to its contemporary phenomena and ramifications across the globe, ranging from Europe, North America, to Chinese and local contexts. The course ends with a discussion of the situation in post-colonial Hong Kong."

"The last two decades witness the rise of vibrant new social movements in the field of sexuality, which, together with many other intersecting social forces, has tremendously reshaped the socio-political landscapes, here and abroad. This course aims to examine the historical trajectory of queer movements as well as the issues and debates pertinent to them so as to make sense of the complexity of sexual politics in the late modern society. It also poses challenges to the commonly held division between academy and social activism by examining their intertwined but not very smooth relationship. To that end, the course will draw on the works of lesbian and gay historians such as Lillian Faderman, Jeffrey Weeks, John D’Emilio and Michel Foucault to lay a social constructionist framework through which the emergence of polymorphous sexual subjects is understood. The social construction of homosexuality in Hong Kong since the 1980s will be discussed as a case in point. The works of Diana Fuss, Judith Butler and Eve Segewick will guide us to explore the internal dilemma of identity politics and the queer turn in the study of sexuality."
"AI have radically changed our idea of who we are, how we behave, and our notion of identity, agency, and society. This course explores the fascinating intersection of computation, digital technologies, and ethical concerns, exploring pivotal questions regarding the relationship between AI functionality (and dysfunctionality), human labor, and humanities. What is the labor, environmental, and social issues behind the use of AI? Where does human agency lie in the world undergirded by various systems of machines, networks of computers, and the cloud? This course introduces key intellectual commitments of digital studies and its recent engagement with AI ethics, including untangling the stories we tell ourselves about human uniqueness in face of machine intelligence, the material infrastructure of information, and the ethics issues that arise in the evolving landscape of AI infusion. In this class, we will use various media, including movies, anime, and documentaries as illustrations to facilitate the critical assessment of conceptual frameworks."
"This course will focus on introducing the various theories, methods and practices of writing film criticism, regarding especially narrative films. It aims to achieve three particular goals: 1. to introduce to students different methods and techniques of film criticism, including the humanist, auteurist, genre, social science, historical, and aesthetics analyses of film texts, in order to understand the distinct history and development of each of these theoretical schools; 2. to acquire the skill to read film texts against their specific discursive background, and to dissect, deconstruct and critique the ideology behind the cinematic images; and 3. to learn to integrate one’s cinematic experience in terms of emotion and reason, and to develop one’s unique style in writing film critiques for recent films in popular magazines. In the course of teaching, three aspects will be highlighted including the critical, functional and practical aspects, and students’ ability for critical exchanges and practical writing training in film criticism will be emphasized. As much as possible, local film critics will be invited to share with students their writing experience in class."
"The idea of the Anthropocene – the geological Age of Man – has become widely adopted as a way of describing the entanglement of human activities and the natural world after its popularization by Paul Crutzen in 2000. In the age of the Anthropocene, challenges arising from global environmental change are numerous: extreme weather, land and water pollution, species extinction, toxic contamination, just to name a few. These challenges are now raising concerns both from scholars in the natural science and from the humanities and the social sciences. This course works on a rapidly growing field of Enviornmental Humanities constituted by the work of scholars from a wide variety of disciplines including history, literature, philosophy, cultural studies, religion studies, arts.It aims to provide students with some recent methodological and theoretical approaches of understanding the anthropocene, including cultural ecology, environmental history, science studies, poststructuralist cultural studies, and eco-feminism. Envisioning the field as a trandisciplinary arena, the course will foster students to think across disciplinary borders in order to tackle the environmental and social challenges of current times."
"Cultural studies has sustained concern on everyday life with mass production, consumerism, sexism, racism and postmodernism, but the discipline is always thought to be lagging behind the concern of nature and animal. Nevertheless, as the issues of animal abuse, environmental protection, factory farming, protection policy, law-making and media portrayals of animals are the hot topics in our (post)modern culture, the study of animal with the perspective of cultural studies and other humanity disciplines can explore the possibilities of an advanced human-animal relationship. This course is designed with an empathic concern of other-than-human animals. By exploring different issues of human and animals’ life, this course looks for a harmonious balance of nature and modern culture."
"This course is designed to study Hong Kong from the perspectives of HK discourses formed in the past decades, with emphasis on the post-1997 context, where we witness the proliferation of HK discourses consolidating, contesting or displacing each other incessantly. In this course we will examine them in both breadth and depth; topics discussed include (post)coloniality, transborder, city and space awareness, variegated localism, China factor, cosmopolitanism, mega-region, generation, social movement, etc. While the topics are not in strict chronological order and each has a narrative of its own, they are unfolded in a sequence that overall form a historical picture of Hong Kong and its discourse formation. For each topic, students will be introduced with theoretical concepts, narrative and representations involved. Students will also get to know some key scholars involved in the discussion. Not shun from taking position, students are encouraged to keep open-minded and evaluate the issues critically, particularly to treat the discourses as ongoing process rather than static products. While we focus on one topic per week for explication purpose, students should note the intricate relationship among the related topics, and keep in mind to build the linkage and dialogue among them."
"Since 1989, the independent film has become the unique window to understand the real China beyond the national mainstream discourse and state-controlled film industry. The content of independent films reflects the various social problems and cultural phenomena confronting contemporary China in its rapid economic development. This course, in surveying its development of the past three decades, strives to describe the changes of the internal environment of the independent film’s circles, explore the aesthetic characteristics as well as, politics, ethics and techniques of the Chinese independent film."
"This course aims to trace affinities and linkages among cultural processes, geopolitical conditions, and media representations within the greater Asian region, broadly defined. Expanding its scope beyond a single nation, race, or language, the course builds on the comparativist work of Benedict Anderson, Chen Kuan-hsing, Aihwa Ong, and Anna Tsing in Asian Studies and Inter-Asia Cultural Studies to uncover the multiplicity of diverse Asias. Its focal points are keywords, objects, and images that would have social resonance in particular locations and societies. Examining their global interchange through an array of print, audiovisual, and digital media, it focuses on their variance in form, use, and meaning across distinct spatial environments and historical periods with a spotlight on vernacular perspectives and experiences.In each semester, the course will explore a combination of the following questions: How are different understandings of ‘neoliberalism,’ development,’ and ‘democracy’ exemplified by contrasting conditions of political, social, and historical transformation? How are the racial, ethnic, or religious identities of Chinese-ness or Muslim-ness shaped by diaspora, tourism, and media? How is the experience and consumption of nostalgia configured by particular conditions of intensifying economic and emotional instability? How is colonialism a system that exceeds the dichotomy between East and West to encompass intraregional hierarchies centered on the economic and cultural superiority of Japan or China? How have interactions and exchanges among intellectuals, revolutionaries, and migrants constituted imaginaries of ‘pan-Asianism’? With this transnational orientation, the course hopes to expand the locus of the discussion beyond Asia to encompass its trans-oceanic connections with Africa and Latin America."
"Fandom, or fan culture, is a term that accompanies lots of stigma in the past and is now a fancy entry into cyberspace subculture in the web 2.0(or even web 3.0) era. It describes communities built by like-minded people in any aspect of popular culture, such as sports, movies, television dramas or music, who actively produce creative content for their uses. As Henry Jenkins once suggested, most fan cultures show elements of participatory culture, as fan communities enjoy their own readings of popular culture and encourage artistic creations and expression. While scholars of popular culture criticise consumers of popular content as ""disciplined readers"" who are being manipulated by the culture industry and follow suit the mass culture, scholars who underpinned the participation of fans consider popular culture consumers as poachers who appropriate ideas from the media text and reinterpret them in creative ways. Therefore, by focusing on fan activities, this field of study provides gateways for further investigation of both individual and collective human agency in media and popular culture through community building, mass consumption, subculture in mediascape and participatory culture. Through this course, students will learn the relationship between fan cultures concerning consumer culture, identity formation, gift economy, emotion economy etc., in contemporary mediascapes."
"Cultural meanings of health and disease are shaped not only by scientific and medical discourses but also by media technologies, from film to smart phones to medical imaging technologies like X-rays. Through an interdisciplinary approach that combines cultural studies, media studies, science and technology studies, and cultural anthropology, this course examines how the media of medicine shapes well-being and vitality in a global context of profound inequality and geopolitical tension. Through topics like mental health, vaccine politics, surveillance, clinical research ethics, and refugee medicine, we will learn how media shapes ideas of normal vs. abnormal, public support for health interventions, and how individuals and collectives understand and contest biomedical knowledge. Our investigations will show us why some people's bodies and lives are made to suffer more in the name of public health and medical advancement—which often reflect race, class, gender, sexuality, and other categories of social difference— and why the legacies of colonialism in health and medicine persist in both local and global contexts.This course is open to all, and no background in medicine is necessary."
"This course looks into basic theoretical perspectives and areas of interests in cultural studies. At the knowledge level, this core course is to survey in some detail how the cultural turn in humanities and social sciences helps us understand everyday life in a fresh way, for example ways in which we are being constructed and reshaped by our experience of everyday life, as well as the embedded values (in financial terms and ethical terms) are being forged and circulated explicitly and implicitly. This course seeks to encourage among students attitude of openness to new ideas and learning creatively through living."
"The course aims to introduce concepts, theories and practices of various management issues in arts organizations, including strategic management, human resources management, financial management, PR & Marketing management, management ethics etc. Students will be introduced to management issues through both theories and case studies. Application of management concepts and principles in performing, visual, and film/video arts organizations will be highlighted. Students are encouraged to evaluate the concepts and principles to their work environments and/or areas of interest in the arts and cultural industries."
"This course provides a comprehensive training of various keywords, institutions, processes, and issues in relation to visual arts management under the curriculum of critical / cultural studies as primary artistic research and practice. The objective of this course is to provide students with an opportunity to become familiar with the specific vocabulary, the logistics, analytical skills, and processes of art institutions both public and private, the current debates and discourses around the various hegemony and socio-cultural issues that define the spectra of the modern and contemporary visual arts. This course is meant to serve as an introduction to various topics in visual art administration and deepened understanding of basic principles of the ecology of the visual arts and its industries, institutions, and artistic projects especially focusing on the art scene in Hong Kong and Asia."
"The aims of the course are to examine the relationship between the performing arts and the community, the evolution and main players of arts policy in Hong Kong, and for students to gain general understanding of the many facets of performing arts administration and be able to discuss related issues with some insights and to learn basic skills in performing arts administration. It covers topics on performing arts administration, including an introduction of arts policy and development of arts provision in Hong Kong, current arts infrastructure in Hong Kong, planning and organizational structure, audience development and arts education, sponsorship and fundraising, etc."
"This course introduces students to different methodologies and materials significant in studying the past, and in particular, the usefulness of combining both textual and non- textual materials in analysing the history, environment, and culture of our local communities. The course will be team-taught by specialists who focus on both the theory and practice of historical preservation. Students will learn about the concepts and methods concerning doing fieldwork, conducting oral history, analysing archaeological artifacts and remains, collecting and exhibiting Hong Kong’s material culture in local museums, preserving historical architecture, and making use of archival studies in China and Hong Kong."
"The cultural and creative industries have become the central to policies around the world as in the promotion of a Global Creative Economy. Art, culture and technological innovation are employed in the branding of cities in order to compete on the global stage, contributing to inequality and sky-rocketing property prices in urban centres like Hong Kong, Paris and Tokyo. Cultural policies are resulting in major cultural development projects in the accelerated modernisation of China. These projects, including the Greater Bay Area as part of the Belt and Road Initiative will transform the life, culture and economy in these regions and around the world. In consideration of these developments, how can artists and practitioners consider their own roles within this economy, without being complicit or left behind? In this class, students will gain a deeper understanding of the global cultural economy and how cultural policies impact the work of practitioners. Topics around cultural work and labour conditions, ideologies of technological innovation and entrepreneurship, soft power and cultural diplomacy and creative cities and the role of art and culture in urban regeneration will be discussed in the course. This course will aid students in developing tools for analysing and critiquing cultural development projects and policies through different theoretical and artistic perspectives to support their own research and practice in the field."

"In Hong Kong popular culture, Xiqu (sometimes know as Chinese Opera) is used as a symbol of “China” in advertisement, theatre and other kinds of performing arts. This course is aimed at introducing the essential artistic elements of Xiqu and analyzing different kinds of mutations and transformations in practicing. We will study the challenges and junctures when Xiqu meets the other art-form. Also we will use Cantonese Opera as an example to probe into the linkage between local culture and the characteristics of different Xiqu culture in different perspectives, including gender, nationality and ritual."
"One of the most challenging aspects of visual arts management is the practice of curatorship. With the rapid global growth of museums and the popularity of the biennale culture, curatorial interpretation has become an influential force in shaping the definition of art and museum. Exhibition venues are the places where various artistic practices and concepts intermingle and drift. Act of curating is not only administrative and managerial activities but becomes part of the exhibition itself nowadays. Thus, this course provides the idea of the curatorial and its history, theory, and praxis. This course nurtures students’ creative and interpretive skills in conceiving and developing curatorial ideas, equips students with the technical, managerial, and communicative skills in planning, organizing, and interpreting exhibitions. It also introduces a critical study of practice of curatorship, reviewing its traditions, limitations and possibilities for abuses and development.Prerequisite course(s): CULS5307"
"Special Topics in Cultural Management IThe specific topics of this course vary from year to year. It will focus each time on a fully developed topic on cultural management that is not covered in the regular course offerings of the programme. As the topic of this course changes from year to year, students are allowed to take this course more than once (not within the same term) and gain the units each time they pass the course. However, students cannot take the same topic twice."
"In order to attract public participation and media attention, cultural institutions are giving more emphasis to organizing large scale cultural programmes such as biennales, arts festivals and multi-disciplinary events. Organizing such mega projects involves huge budget, complicated technical arrangement, large number of staff, artists and diversified progrmames. The course studies not only the organization, management and promotion of the various types of large scale cultural presentations, ranging from thematic arts festivals, multi-disciplinary projects, public entertainment, community arts projects to celebrative events, but also nurtures students’ curatorial capability in identifying, developing and implementing programmes for these mega-cultural projects. Students are required to have taken CULS 5308 before they could take this course. Exception can be made if evidence of previous working experience in performing arts management is provided."
Students are encouraged to gain practical experience through this programme. Every year the Department will identify appropriate projects and inform students normally at least one month before the beginning of school term for application. A selection process is required as opportunity from this programme is limited. Based on the nature of projects. specially designed schemes will be worked out with the students and a supervisor will be assigned. Final evaluation is based on supervisor’s evaluation and project reports by the students.
"In the last decade, there has been a significant growth in the number and types of arts and cultural venues in East and Southeast Asia. Increasingly, cultural managers are expected to contribute to the day-to-day operations of various types of cultural venues. At the same time, cultural managers are also taking on key roles in the venues’ programming decisions. Many of these new venues are developed as cultural landmarks of their respective cities (for instance, the rapid roll out of performing arts centres and museums in Mainland China) or revitalized from existing heritage sites. Apart from these mega cultural venues’ projects, there is also a growing number of non-conventional arts and cultural spaces initiated by business owners and cultural organizations. The pandemic has also triggered new thinking in the role of physical cultural venues as well as accelerated the shift towards digital venue and art tech. This course aims to address all the above issues."
"Members of communities develop both social and cultural capital through collaborative and participatory artmaking. The course explores the philosophy, practices and ethical issues on how the arts bring about community development and regeneration, education/ lifelong learning, communication, cultural citizenship, among other things."
"With the development of technologies, contemporary filmmaking has become faster and flexible. This practical course is designed for storytellers who want to translate their ideas into compelling videos. Though pre-production, filming, to post-production, students will learn the visual-audio language, basic skills and techniques of filmmaking, including camera shooting, sound recording, lighting, editing by using Adobe Premiere and After Effect, etc. It consists of lectures, readings, screenings and consultations, hands-on visual projects and mini workshops; helps students to explore their conceptual and aesthetic styles in the end."
"The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted the arts and cultural sectors worldwide and has highlighted the need for research in this academic field on issues such as skills gaps, digital delivery and new business models in cultural management that require urgent attention. A single course on Special Topics in Cultural Management is no longer sufficient to cover new topics related to this time of massive transformation in the arts and cultural sectors. Special Topics in Cultural Management II focuses on a specific topic on cultural management that is not covered in the regular course offerings of the cultural management programme. It aims to enrich the programme with fully developed topics concerning cultural management. As the content of this course changes from year to year, students are allowed to take this course more than once (not within the same term) and gain the units each time they pass the course. However, students cannot take the same topic twice."
Seminars in Cultural Management comprises of 3-4 current and cutting-edge research themes in cultural management. These themes are updated according to the current developments in cultural management. Classes are conducted in seminar style and each theme could be taught by a different instructor (co-teaching).
"This course will study contemporary art systems and institutions as cultural forms within the broader ‘cultural ecology’ of modern cities such as Hong Kong. It will consider the development of post-formalist art forms and time-based media such as installation art, digital media art, video art and performance art and how these art forms are employed within traditional art spaces, public spaces, social media platforms and activist movements. The aim of the course is also to introduce students to a general historical framework of contemporary art with a focus on dialogic aesthetics and participatory art forms. The students will learn about movements and concepts and how to apply these discourses by researching Hong Kong artists as well as traditional and grassroots institution and cultural precincts. Finally, students will contribute to artistic discourses by curating an innovative work of contemporary art and artist residency. The course will outline institutional and promotional structures of art curating and the benefits of cultural interactivity and exchange."
"This course explores the intersection/interface of the technological and the cultural, especially in relation to immersive (sometimes called ‘pervasive’) media in everyday life (in the use of mobile devices, PDAs, games and mobile games consoles, MPS players, interactive video screens in public spaces/shopping centres etc) and in the increasing use of interactivity in new media research and its creative applications in museum display and interactive and new media arts. The course is concerned to chart the development of new technocultural forms of literacy and their conceptual frameworks in cognitive and affective thought processes, in ‘information aesthetics’ and in distributed network theory. The aim is to understand the cultural implications of these developments as well as considering cultural and economic dimensions of the transformation of the ‘public sphere’ in, for example, the use of tracking and surveillance technologies for both security and market research activities."
"This course is designed to trace the histories of photographic technologies, from the optical experiments of the early modern period (the camera obscura) to the emergent forms of mass entertainment in the nineteenth century (photography, the diorama and the panorama) to contemporary digital forms (the mobile phone photograph and the web-cam), from assumptions of analogical certainty to digital image manipulation. The course will consider the histories of techniques embedded in new tools of impage production (the metaphoric containment, for example, of the histories of painting, photography and printing in programs like Photoshop). The course will also consider the impact of new photomedia technologies on public access to archive resources in digitization projects and new systems of database design and indexing which image resources require. A consideration of new regimes of intellectual property will also be studied."
"This course will introduce key techniques and methodologies used to analyze visual images in their various forms. Focusing on sources in both popular and high culture, in China, Hong Kong and the West, the course will examine aspects of thought and expression in self-image and identity, drawing upon cultural and aesthetic frameworks. The aim of the course is to equip students with high-level skills in image and cultural analysis and to understand current debates in intercultural visual studies. Key texts in the history and theory of global visual culture and visual studies will be subjected to close critical reading, drawing upon the insights of interdisciplinary approaches. Students will study art-historical, culturological and semiotic debates on the status of the image, inflected by recent developments in new media theory and ‘image science’ and gender and post-colonial studies."
"This course aims at introducing history and theory of documentary in film, video, digital moving image, and new media including web-based archive and multi-media web communities. This is not a regular class on documentary film history. Rather, it explores the idea of documentation throughout history on various media. Realism as a mode of discourse will be re-examined. General concepts, aesthetics, ethics, practices and modes of documentary production will be introduced in lectures, followed up by discussions in tutorials. Research methods will also be discussed from various modes of documentary productions."
"This course will introduce visual and sensory research methods to enable innovative research projects, drawing on frameworks in art history, visual anthropology, new media and cultural research. Students will learn techniques of formal and compositional analysis and study the history of objects and material and intangible culture. They will study questions of ethnographic method, observational and interview skills and visual data production, as well as ethics in fieldwork and in the use of images. The use of photography and video will be presented. Exercise in photo-elicitation, photo- documentation, and image-text and image-sound combination, (photo-essays, soundscape composition etc) will be undertaken as well as basic skills in video composition, videography and editing. New media techniques for image display will be studied as well as methods of archive research focusing on images, film, video and sound. Methods of image classification and interpretation will be introduced. The course will enhance students’ capacities in undertaking visually-focused research projects in community and professional contexts."
"This course is designed to introduce digital culture in web 2.0. It aims to engage learning of cultural activities that takes place in social networking setting. User-generated content is the main form of cultural text that we will examine in this course. The course begins with an understanding of basic theories in cultural studies. Students are expected to understand the fluid nature that culture becomes in the globally connected internet world. The course secondly introduces concepts that are recently developed in the study of user-generated content. It introduces emerging cultural concepts including creative labor, produsage, mashup, convergence, participatory creativity, networked community, remixed culture, copyleft and controlled regulation. The course also includes specific case discussion on how user-generated content is studied in the field of digital humanity. The approach of this course emphasizes lecture, discussion of reading materials, student presentation and applied media practice in student projects."
"“Meaning is present in every movement from the flutter of an eyelid to a space-splitting leap” (Terry, 1997). Dance has been regarded as an art form, an integral part of religion, culture, and community. It is also one of the prime subjects for cultural analysis.The course introduces students to the principles, concepts and practices found within dances, theater, and performing arts. Theatrical terminology, visual symbolism, ethnic identity, aesthetics, ideology and evolution of dance and theater in a variety of cultures and historical periods will be discussed, topics include: dance in relation to cultural identity or political power, semantics of movement and costumes, lighting and theater design analysis, globalization and media.In addition, this course broadens the scope of choreography analysis and practices. Activities include: Encoding and decoding dance movements, improvisations and self-expressions, theater and dance production, dance workshops."
"This course examines the intersection of urban and cinematic experiences, it will investigate the images that define and brand cities, their implications to our future life, and it also encourages students to record and decipher their own experiences and imagine their living cities with self-produced short films essay that counteract emerging global cityscapes. Based on the theories of Gilles Deleuze, cinematic image as a thinking tool is used to see and reflect on the world and the experience of it. Certain poetic languages of cinema and urban theories are introduced as a plethora of expressive visual languages for students to examine their own thinking and experience in the city critically and reflectively."
"The twentieth century is a period of rupture for Chinese arts, in which artists experimented ferociously to develop different forms of modern arts that could respond to drastic social change. A central concern is to transform Chinese visual arts into both modern and Chinese, representing an independent people and nation marching into modernity. Developed around the visual arts, the course would ultimately like to ask a political question: is there a national style? This course focuses primarily on the Chinese arts, but we will also pay attention to artistic movements outside China. We will explore different genres of visual arts as well as the overall social and political order of the time. In contrast to the traditional art history approach, this course is devoted to the investigation of how arts and politics became so mutually constitutive with each other in the Chinese context, and how the revolution discourse relied heavily on the arts to connect to the people. We will also explore how Maoist arts cannot be understood simply as political tool. In addition to providing a general overview of the development of arts, we will also investigate the meanings of artistic freedom in China, and explore the identity of artists and authors under an official ideology in which collectivity is deemed much more important than individuals. At a time when nationalism perpetuates Chinese society, a revisit of the “national style” of Chinese arts developed in the twentieth century invites students to reflect on the meanings of Chinese arts beyond narrow-minded Sino-centric frameworks. We could instead go back to some basic aesthetic values and concepts such as emancipation, democracy, and plurality. This course is as much one of art history as one of political and intellectual history."
"An introductory seminar to all postgraduate research students beginning in the field of cultural studies, with the special focus on the understanding of contemporary culture. While no single course can aptly fulfill this enormous task, in this seminar we will tackle specifically the interactions of three major forces making up contemporary culture, namely, modernity, capitalism, and globalization. We will discuss their underlying ideologies and mechanism, and how they interact to form a larger network conditioning our everyday lives. We will investigate not only how they constitute contemporary culture discursively but also how their differences or sometimes contradictory agendas created rooms for interrogations and alternatives. This course is designed to provide a macro framework for students to understand certain major social mechanisms at work, but students are also expected to provide their own micro readings of contemporary culture to comprehend, supplement, and criticize these theoretical writings. (Course description revised in 2006-07)"
"In this course students will understand representations broadly, examining different kinds of literary, visual, and cultural texts, while taking into consideration of not resorting them as direct mirror of reality. But the main purpose of the course is not to simply expand the possible meanings and manifestations of the notion of “text”. Through various examples, we want to theorize what representation is and can be. We will examine the complex relationships between form and content, production and reception, theories and the actual materiality and non-discursiveness of culture. The course materials include various perspectives to understand the nature and the politics of representation, and it also includes selected examples of scholarly interpretations of different representations that could benefi t students’ own research."

"This course investigates the basic concepts and issues relevant to a critical understanding of the relationship between meaning, interpretation, and text. Selected works of an artistic, historical or philosophical nature will be studied as the contextual expression of cultural ideas and values.

"This course examines the slippery category of “things” that has emerged in the past decade as an interdisciplinary endeavor involving anthropologists, political scientists, philosophers, literary critics and natural scientists among others. The new field of studies considers ontological ideas about the relationship between humans and 'things'. In her book Vibrant Matter (2011), political theorist Jane Bennett argues that non-human forces actively participate in socio-economic and political process, and that matters or “things” possess power that is not reducible to human meanings. This course asks students to throw away old conceptualization that human makes things and history. It turns the question around to ask how “things” make people and how to have a new imagination of world politics and social justice based on new connection between human and non-human “things.” Can things, such as technology, corporeality and matters be understood as having a form of subjectivity, being, and agency of their own? Can we think of a new way of understanding the social with non-human “things?”"
"This course aims to examine the notion of Chineseness from historical, cultural and socio-political perspectives, focusing not only on questions of territoriality, migration and (post)coloniality but also on issues of language and agency. Besides close reading of key texts on the topic, the course will also highlight the processes through which knowledge about Chineseness has been produced, and the institutional mechanisms and discursive powers underlying such knowledge production. It will engage, in particular, with diaspora studies and Sinophone studies to demonstrate the complex and contested notion of Chineseness."
"This course is interested in the interaction, passage, and convergence between different modalities of media production and representation. Exploring the theoretical, semantic, and historical relationships among cinema, photography, visual art, and social media, it will examine the complex, ambivalent intermedial space between image and text, print and audio, analog and digital, and platform and infrastructure.The term ‘inter-’ might suggest a smooth, uninterrupted state or process of synergy. This course will uncover how intermedial encounters or exchanges within disparate social, historical, and cultural milieus are messy, contingent, and pluralistic situations of juxtaposition, overlap, and negotiation. In such intermedial situations, the components, functions, and processes of different media modalities are often modulated, constricted, or subtracted to be made more workable and effective within larger ecologies of signification and usage."
