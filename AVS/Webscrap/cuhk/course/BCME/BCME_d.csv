"The Chinese Medicine Specialty Clinical Practice is a module scheduled in the second year of the programme. Through clinical training, it enables students to utilize what they have learnt in previous pre-clinical classes. The course offers clinical placement at several CUHK-associated Chinese medicine hospitals/clinics in mainland and Hong Kong. They serve as the venues for Chinese medicine specialty praxis. It is expected that each student will have not less than 80 clinical contact hours during the semester to observe and practice Chinese medicine in selected specialties,(include acupuncture & moxibustion), and to formulate treatment strategies for encountered clinical cases. The module is designed to build up a strong foundation for developing specialized knowledge and skills in their future Chinese medicine career."
"This course introduces the theory and application of different research methodologies on Chinese medicine (CM) researches. It deals with research methodologies in two major streams: ancient classics and modern literature. Students are encouraged to critical appraise different types of scientific evidences in CM studies and apply their training to analyze clinical problems, to make clinical decisions, to identify prevention and treatment of diseases, and to further develop their own CM research. It covers literature search, literature review on CM classics, data management & statistics analysis, systematic review & meta-analysis. Moreover, this module prepares students to gain an analytical mind and critical thinking, and to train up their skills in thesis writing. Students need to draft a research protocol at the end of the course and perform an oral presentation. They will continue their studies in the next semester and submit a final thesis after attending BCME 6123 “Research methodologies and essay writing (II) ”. These two courses are geared towards equipping graduates to continue with doctoral studies or research development in tertiary institutions or Hong Kong Chinese Medicine Hospital in the future."
"Based on the knowledge gained in BCME6122 “Research Methodologies and Essay Writing (I)”, students are expected to conduct an evidence-based research in Chinese medicine (CM) discipline, including acupuncture and moxibustion.  CM research stream includes ancient classics and modern literature.  Student needs to complete the thesis under the supervision and guidance of a supervisor. The purpose of a thesis is to demonstrate the students’ ability to develop an in-depth knowledge of a selected research topic, to critically and systematically integrate different types of scientific evidences in CM studies, to employ appropriate methodology, statistics analysis and research skills, and to clearly present and discuss the conclusions as well as the knowledge and arguments that form the basis for these findings. Each student is mandated to submit an essay of about 5,000 words to report the objective, method, result and discussion of his/her research and to present the content in an oral defense at the end of the semester."
"This course is a fundamental course in Chinese medicine. The content consists of two parts. For the first part, through the systematic introduction of the basic theories of Chinese medicine with topics like yin-yang, vital activities of the body, meridians, viscera and bowels, causes and mechanisms of diseases and methods of diagnosis, students will be able to master the philosophical thoughts of Chinese medicine, the basic theories on the human body and diseases, and the principles of health maintenance and treatment. This course also explains the essence of pattern differentiation and treatment determination and concept of holism, which are the unique characteristics of Chinese medicine.The second part of the course will discuss basic knowledge and skills concerning how to collect clinical information, diagnose diseases and differentiate patterns based on the basic theories of Chinese medicine. The students will be able to master the basic theories, fundamental knowledge and skills concerning the four diagnostic methods in Chinese medicine including observation, olfaction and auscultation, inquiring and palpation. Upon the completion of the course, the students will be capable of making clinical diagnosis using common pattern differentiation methods encompassing eight rubrics, etiology & qi, blood and body fluids, visceral differentiations. Emphasis will be placed on training students’ practical skills in four diagnostic methods, differentiating clinical patterns and writing clinical case notes so that the course will lay a solid foundation for future studies of clinical subjects."
"Ancient Chinese medicine books are important materials for research and learning on Chinese medicine. By reading the first-hand ancient texts, the progress of the historical and the theory development of TCM could be revealed, and deep readings are valuable in enhancing the understanding of TCM. In the course, scholars will be invited to share their academic views on several renowned TCM ancient books. Students can attend the lectures according to their own interest to enhance knowledge towards specific topics. Discussions among students and tutors are highly encouraged. Various teaching and learning methods such as tutorials, e-learning and reports will be used to improve students’ ability in reading ancient texts and applying the theory and knowledge in clinical practice."
"Acupuncture accidents and their prevention, which is an important issue during clinical practice, encompasses the relevant aspects from basic to clinical departments. Aiming to provide safe clinical acupuncture and moxibustion treatment, the course will elaborate the common accidents, anatomy of acupoints in the dangerous area, the methods to locate some important acupoints, and essential tips for needling manipulation. For the part of progress in research development of acupuncture and moxibustion, it will comprise mechanisms of acupuncture and moxibustion, the exploration on the meridians and acupoints, development of clinical research methodology on acupuncture, and also the most advanced development of acupuncture and moxibustion treatment for some common diseases."
"Clinical Practice Training is an important part of the TCM teaching. Through clinical practice, the students may improve deep learning of basic theory, and enhance the clinical knowledge and skills. The clinical practice training will last for one year and a half. The students will go to different training sites by stages in mainland and Hong Kong, and receive clinical training on various specialties of Chinese medicine, including internal medicine, surgery, gynecology, pediatric, acupuncture, surgery, bone setting, ophthalmology and otolaryngology, and dermatology. The students are anticipated to have the ability to appropriately treat the common diseases after completing the training."

"Chinese medicine research, an emerging research topic, incorporates Chinese medicine theory, modern clinical trial methods, biostatistics and epidemiology, preclinical and translational research, phytochemistry, basic science research. Thus this course will deeply emphasize the modern Chinese medicine research in various scopes and related methodology, and deepen students on their knowledge on writing research proposal."
"This course aims to provide a fundamental knowledge of acupuncture knowledge, which will enable the students to carry on the clinical studies and to practice acupuncture in the latter part of the Programme. This course comprises two parts: Meridians (Channels and Collaterals) and Acupoints. Part I will systematically introduce the components of meridian system, the physiology and pathology of meridians and their applications in the diagnosis and treatment in acupuncture practice. Part II will introduce the classification and function of acupoints, the local anatomical knowledge of main acupoints and the applications of commonly used acupoints. Particular emphasis will be placed on the study of the Specific Points including their modern research and clinical use."
