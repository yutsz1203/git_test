"Dilemmas – difficult problems or situations without easy answers – are common and inevitable in personal, professional, and civic life. How can I balance my own dreams with the wishes of my family? What is the best way to behave ethically while also making money for my company? How can a society address the needs of the majority of its citizens while also protecting the weak and needy? Resolving dilemmas often involves making choices between different options or courses of action, or resolving differences between competing interests and priorities. In this course, we will explore ways of thinking about dilemmas, drawing on the insights of classical and modern thinkers. We will also examine a number of contemporary problems and explore their histories and backgrounds. Guest lecturers will present case studies in their own fields of study or professions. The course will not attempt to present a comprehensive survey of moral and political philosophy. Rather, we seek to excite your interest and enthusiasm for taking on big questions and give you some tools for thinking about them. Our hope is that you will continue to explore these and other questions throughout your years at the university."
"The Service Learning/Civic Engagement component of Morningside College’s General Education Programme gives students the opportunity to engage in substantive service work. The goal of the course is to allow students to apply in practical settings for the benefit of others some of what they are learning in the classroom, and to help them discover how they can make their own positive impact on the world. The course also inspires students to explore perennial questions of human existence and human values."
