"The purpose of the course is to provide a comprehensive account of the nature and impact of family-school-community (FSC) collaboration in education. The course will examine the relationship between family, school, and community for children‘s education, parents empowerment and school improvement. For the past two decades, growing evidence shows that parents are valuable but largely untapped resources for the field of education. In Hong Kong, FSC collaboration is of particular interest to policy makers and educators because it may have considerable potential to address three major problems in public education: scarcity of resources; rigidity of bureaucracy; and quality and inequality of educational outcomes. The course will help participants understand how to obtain higher and better participation from all families regardless of their background; and to enhance the inclusive attitude of educators (including teachers, social workers, etc.) to address the diverse needs of parents and their children."

This course will systematically examine the theories and research on parenting cognitions and practices from a psychological perspective. We will examine different determinants of parenting, including parents' characteristics, children's characteristics, as well as the family and sociocultural contexts in which both parents and children are embedded. The effects of parenting on children will also be examined, with attention to the processes through which these effects occur."
"Against the context of industrialization and modernization, there are changes in family structure/ form and functioning. These changes, together with the emergence of the concepts of ‘childhood’ and ‘motherhood’, have tremendous impacts on the ideal of parenthood and parenting practices. Such ideal and practices are subsequently challenged in a post-industrial/ post-modern era. This course seeks to provide sociological perspectives to understanding parenting in a variety of social, cultural, and historical contexts, which will enable students to make sense of parenting practices in Hong Kong. The implications of such parenting practices for social inequality and social development will also be discussed."

"This course focuses on the inquiry about: 1) the definition of teaching; 2) learning theories and their application to teaching; 3) models of learning and their teaching effectiveness; 4) theories and designs of teaching; 5) models of teaching; 6) individual differences and adaptive teaching; and 7) variables, methods, paradigms and applications of research on teaching. Examples and case-studies will be chosen in accordance with the professional background of the participants."
"Different approaches in organizing school curricula are based on different rationale and conceptualization concerning curriculum activities in schools. The nature and forms of knowledge constitute an important component in understanding and designing school curricula. Other relevant factors include school structure and culture, teachers’ subject identity and status of subject, etc. In this course, the different ways of curriculum organization are delineated and evaluated in the light of epistemological considerations. Analysing the different areas of human experience and knowledge should lead to a reconceptualization of the task of organizing curriculum from a higher standpoint. In this course, the design and implementation problems of different ways of curriculum organization, such as discipline-based curriculum, integrated curriculum and modular curriculum in different stages of education will be studied. This exercise of reflection should better prepare course participants for the practical task of curriculum design."
"This course is designed for those students who wish to have in-depth explorations of curriculum issues from different paradigms, namely Traditionalism/ Conceptual- empiricism/ Reconceptualism, and Perennial Analytic/ Practical Inquiry/ Critical Praxis paradigm. The course focuses on: 1) the application of above paradigms on the decisions of the nature and relationship of curriculum common places, such as the selection of aims and objectives, learning opportunities, teachers, learners and teaching/ learning environment, and social milieu/ context; and 2) the application of above paradigms in understanding the processes of curriculum development, implementation and evaluation as well as in designing modes of curriculum inquiry."
"This is a foundational course on contemporary education theories that prepares doctoral students to engage with theories in educational research. The course extends beyond the scope of “educational administration and policy” but considers, broadly, the epistemological, theoretical and methodological considerations of applying theory in educational research. The course is structured around four themes with each block focusing on a few key theorists and their theoretical ideas. The overall aim of the course is to induct and provoke doctoral students to think theoretically and reflexively with theory for their doctoral dissertation and future educational research."
"This course aims to provide an understanding of the major contextual forces that have shaped local school reform. It seeks to investigate the dynamics of school reform as a global phenomenon and analyze its impact on educational policy and administration at the international, societal, and institutional levels. School reform policies are often viewed as endeavors to enhance national competitiveness in the world arena. New administrative measures can also be perceived as means to attain efficiency and effectiveness. These will be examined. By referring to the experiences of countries, mostly developed ones, which have influenced the direction of local school reform, and drawing insights from relevant research findings, this course will address critical issues in key areas of school reform in this part of the world. Topics to be discussed in this course will include: change in conception of human capital and reform in educational administration, school governance, resource allocation, curricula and teaching, quality assurance, teacher and principal preparations, leadership practices and so on."
"This course aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the complexities of school leadership and of how educational organizations ‘work’. It seeks to locate these understandings within relevant theoretical, empirical and practical contexts. Processes central to effective administration are analyzed in relation to their influence on educational organizations and the ways leaders drive organizational change and development. Acquired knowledge and insights about educational organizations and leadership will be applied to relevant, practically-based problems through the use of case materials, critiques and other analytic tools. Through reviewing and applying a broad range of literature the course aims to encourage students to develop their own conceptualization of educational organizations and leadership approaches as a means to guide their future inquiry in the field."
"This course is designed to provide doctoral students with the opportunity for an advanced training in a range of topics and current issues in quantitative research methodology. The main objective is to equip the students with advanced quantitative research methodology to understand, design, conduct and critically appraise quantitative education research through discussion on real empirical studies that apply widely used methods, such as hierarchical linear modeling, structural equation modeling, multivariate analysis and meta analysis.Topics offered will vary from year to year and rotate on a regular basis. Each year the course will be developed and taught by teaching staff with relevant expertise and experience for the purpose to advance the students' thesis studies."
"This course is designed to cultivate the research ability of doctoral students in adopting the qualitative research approach. To achieve this aim, we place emphasis on the discussion of highly selected exemplary qualitative studies that cover diversified types. To create the condition for thorough deliberation of the reading materials, which constitutes a prerequisite for fruitful discussions, the class meetings are held every two weeks. Where appropriate, the class discussion would be supplemented by the contribution of guest speakers and hands-on research training. By way of class discussion and out-of-class activities, we shall bring out for debates major theoretical, practical, and ethical issues involved in the following decisions throughout the research process: how to design a qualitative study so as to address research questions raised at the outset, what are relevant data that could answer the research questions, how to choose appropriate research methods to collect such relevant data, how to analyse and interpret qualitative data (of various types), and how to present the collected data. Fundamental issues in conducting a qualitative study, ranging from the role of a theoretical or conceptual framework, through the access to subjective, intersubjective, and objective knowledge, to the establishment of its validity and reliability, will also be deliberated."
"In this course, we will (1) introduce advanced methods to analyze quantitative data, including the use of data from large-scale educational surveys, (2) discuss how to find important and interesting stories from the data, and (3) learn to write research reports that are publishable in academic journals."
"This course is designed for doctoral students who want to conduct a qualitative research project. The course will offer the multifaceted and advanced knowledge needed for such work, plus core techniques commonly used in the qualitative research paradigm. Providing students with a comprehensive and sophisticated understanding of philosophical stances underpinning different qualitative methodologies will help them situate their research and shape the deployment of their qualitative inquiry in an informed manner. The course will concentrate on developing students' knowledge and practical skills for conducting qualitative research in the following areas: (1) the use of relevant explanatory and exploratory research questions in different qualitative studies; (2) writing a critical literature review and theoretical sensitivity; (3) formulating a research protocol and the practice of triangulation; (4) hands-on experiences of collecting qualitative data with relevant data collection techniques; (5) data interpretation and analysis through coding practices based on the content analysis approach; (6) having theory building with the application of grounded theory; (7) developing skills to draw conclusions and write reports, both of which serve as the basis for preparing a doctoral research proposal and/or thesis; (8) special attention will be given to the issue of ‘researcher as instrument’ and related ethical issues. To put the knowledge acquired into practice, students will be required to undertake a mini qualitative project individually with rigorous research design. It is anticipated that students will gain the competency to interpret and report their research findings in an academic manner."
"Is scientific approach in educational research possible? What constitute scientific evidence in educational research? In recent years, even though the call for more evidence-based educational practices has become ubiquitous, new instructional innovations and practices have been implemented faster than the accumulation of research evidence. In this course, we will first discuss the meaning of scientific approach in educational research that have shaped the current landscape of the field. Then, we will discuss how this approach enhances the understanding of recent instructional innovations and practices for the improvement of students’ learning. Students of this course are expected to learn about both “form” (i.e., methodology) and “substance” (i.e., content) of educational research by critical analysis of the literature in order to become prepared for leading roles in instructional innovations and practices."
"This course is designed to critically examine the literature on guidance and counselling in primary and secondary schools. The following issues are covered: comprehensive guidance system, whole- school approach to guidance service, models of school counselling and guidance, guidance activities and student development, organization and procedures of school guidance, preventive strategies, remedial and developmental strategies, guidance curriculum, counselling staff training and development, and approaches to evaluation."
"Humans do not grow and develop in a vacuum. From birth, our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are shaped by the dynamic interplay of our genetic makeup and the environment. As children develop, they constantly make sense of the social world around them. Their social cognition, in turn, guides their interactions with others. Indeed, a major goal of socialization is for children to develop the ability to understand and act effectively on the social environment, so that they can function as accepted and competent members of their societies. In this course, we will examine children’s psychosocial development. Potential topics include the nature of human development, achievement motivation, family process and parenting, and changes in youth emotional functioning and interpersonal relationships."
"The purpose of this course is to provide an opportunity for Ed.D. students, under the guidance of their supervisors, to conduct independent study within their specializations and/ or other specializations according to their research interests. The course enables the students to pursue needed study in a field in which appropriate courses are not being offered within the normative period of study. At the completion of the course, students are expected to have enriched their knowledge in their specializations."
"The purpose of this course is to provide an opportunity for Ed.D. students, under the guidance of their supervisors, to explore literature and/ or conduct intital research relevant to their specializations and research interests. Students are expected to address areas including research frameworks, definitions of major concepts, and the possible signifiance of different forms of research and appropriate research methodology."
"Doctoral students will be required to take this course every term from the time of admission, throughout their thesis preparation. The advisor/ supervisor will meet the student on a regular basis and advise the student on all matters related to thesis research."
"Under the supervision of the supervisor and thesis committee members, students are required to conceptualize the research idea, review appropriate literature and carry out preliminary research if necessary. Students have to submit and present the thesis proposal in an open presentation, normally within a year after the advancement to doctoral candidature."
"M.Phil. students will be required to take this course every term from the time of admission, throughout their thesis preparation. The advisor/ supervisor will meet the student on a regular basis and advise the student on all matters related to thesis research."
"Students have to fulfill all the course requirements and satisfy the required attendance. This course is designed to familiarize students with the principles, structure and process of education research, and it is organized into two parts. The first part is in the form of lecture which takes up the first seven sessions of the courses. It aims to provide students with a general understanding of the nature and substance of education research. Thus, topics to be covered in these lectures are major paradigms in education inquiry, the philosophical and ethical issues relating to education research, and the basic principles and procedures in education research. The second part of the course is organized in the form of seminar during the two semesters. Each seminar is conducted by a research student in the Division of Education and is supervised by no less than two members of the teaching staff of the Faculty of Education. Depending on the research interests of the research students conducting the seminars, research ideas and plans in educational studies will be critically reviewed and discussed. (For M.Phil. students only.)"
"The purpose of this course is to enable research students to form, refine, and present research ideas and plans under the supervision of their thesis advisors. Research students should register for this course in at least one semester before their graduation, and are required to independently conduct a seminar on their thesis proposals during that semester. All seminars are supervised by no less than two members of the teaching staff of the Faculty of Education."
