To attend seminars/workshops and carry out assignments for the purposes of increasing knowledge of the research area and improving experimental design and data analysis. This is equivalent to the Common Guided Studies for research methodology as required by the Faculty of Medicine.
To present a seminar summarizing research work performed in the previous term/year.
"This course covers cutting-edge topics in translational genomics and bioinformatics to train students how to use modern computing and bioinformatics tools to answer biomedical questions in a translational and clinical setting. The topics include single-cell multi-omics and spatiotemporal sequencing, artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools such as deep learning frameworks for multi-modal, multi-omics data integrative analysis, experimental platforms such as ex-vivo models for pre-clinical studies, as well as recent advances in the development of novel diagnostics and therapeutics that leverage the power of genomics and bioinformatics. Ethical issues related to the use of genomics and AI in research and clinical applications will also be discussed."
"This course provides an overview of the clinical applications of genomic approaches to human disorders, particularly in relation to clinical genetics, discussing the methods and capabilities of the new technologies. Students learn how to perform diagnostic analysis of the human genome based on next-generation sequencing (NGS), interpret genomic data when making clinical management decisions, and understand ethical issues, legal requirements, and policies. Applications in prenatal testing and cancer diagnosis will be discussed in detail. Tutorials and hands-on experience in data analysis will be provided, including the interpretation of NGS data."
