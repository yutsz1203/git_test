"This course discusses the principles, structure and application of geographic information systems. It emphasizes on the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to organize and manage spatial data, and how to perform spatial analysis with GIS. Topics include: GPS data acquisition, georelational data model, raster and vector data structures, spatial database, spatial analysis and application issues."
"This course focuses on how geographic information systems (GIS) can be used to support various applications in transportation and logistics. This course covers such topics as shortest paths, routing, network flows, facility location, travel demand analysis, and intelligent transportation systems. Students will use TransCAD (Caliper Corp.) and ArcGIS (ESRI) in this course to gain hands-on experience with GIS-T. The main course objective is to help students gain a better understanding of GIS-T concepts and GIS-T applications."
"This course discusses the principles and applications of remote sensing image analysis. Topics include principle of remote sensing, acquisition of satellite imagery, format of digital images, digital image processing systems, image display, geometric correction, radiometric adjustment, image enhancement, image classification, accuracy verification, change detection, and orthophoto applications. This course is taught with both lectures and laboratories. Lectures will be accompanied by laboratories for students to grasp both the theoretical and practical issues in remote sensing image analysis."
"This course discusses various applications of remote sensing image analysis. The course begins by introducing the basic principle of remote sensing and an overview of remote sensing applications. On one hand, individual topics covering the application of remote sensing in vegetation, urban landscape, water and hydrology are discussed. On the other hand, various kinds of remotely-sensed data including high-resolution, thermal, hyperspectral, radar are introduced. This course is taught with lectures, laboratories and individual projects. Lectures will be accompanied by laboratories for students to grasp both the theoretical and application issues of remote sensing. Students are required to initiate, present and submit individual project to complete the course requirement."
"This course covers the basic principles of Global Positioning Systems (GPS): observables, error sources and their reduction, and positioning techniques. Other systems of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) will also be introduced. Applications of GNSS in various fields will be discussed, including navigation, Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), Location Based Services (LBS), engineering, and atmosphere sensing. Through hands-on exercises, students will learn how to use GPS devices to collect data in the field in support of various geospatial applications."
"This course aims at the concepts and applications of artificial intelligence in solving real-life problems in Smart-City management. Fundamentals of artificial intelligence methods for decision making will be discussed. It covers various paradigms for artificial-intelligence applications in spatial knowledge representation and inference, computational models and intelligent spatial decision support systems (SDSS). The enrichment of spatial decision support by data mining and knowledge discovery will also be examined. Open-source artificial intelligence software systems will be introduced to facilitate discussions, and to assist students to acquire hands-on experience of the relevant knowledge."
"This course covers major concepts and methods for modeling spatial patterns and processes. Topics include cellular automata, agent-based models, terrain modeling, spatio-temporal data modeling, integration of GIS and environmental modeling, noise modeling, modeling of watershed hydrology and water quality and other relevant applications. During the course, students will learn about different modeling approaches and their applications and work on lab exercises and course projects."
"This course covers the basic principles for GIS design and application system implementation using the mainstream techniques. Topics include requirement analysis, object-oriented design using Unified Modeling Language (UML), database normalization, and GIS customization within a GIS environment. Students will develop their competence in designing and customizing GIS tools through lectures, hands-on lab exercises, and a course project."
"This course provides an introduction to the basic and spatial statistical analysis methods that are commonly used to investigate geographically represented data. Topics covered include: (1) correlation analysis, (2) principal components analysis, (3) cluster analysis, (4) Geostatistical analysis, and (5) global and local spatial regression models. Students will develop their competency in using and applying GIS and statistical tools to solve real-world geographical problems through hands-on lab exercises and course projects."
"This course introduces to students geospatial big data (e.g., social media and GPS trajectories) and their applications in urban planning, including land functionality classification, environmental monitoring, sentiment analysis, and transportation planning. The use of GIS in various urban applications relevant to big data will also be covered. These applications encompass urban form, public health, 3D GIS, and geodesign. Through hands-on lab exercises such as data crawling from the web, 3D urban model construction using CityEngine, and geodesign using Geoplanner, students are expected to understand how geospatial big data can be applied to address real-world challenges in the urban environment, and to grasp more advanced skills relating to GIS applications."
"The master thesis project is a compulsory course of the GISM program. It is not a regular course with modules and exercises, but an individual research project where you present your work in an oral presentation and a scientific written report. Students are required to carry out independent studies of selected topics relevant to Geoinformation Science on a variety of problems under staff supervision. Evaluation is based on the oral presentation and written report."
